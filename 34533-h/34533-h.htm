<p><span class="bold">BEDLAM,<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Bethlehem Hospital</span>, the first English
lunatic asylum, originally founded by Simon FitzMary, sheriff
of London, in 1247, as a priory for the sisters and brethren of
the order of the Star of Bethlehem. It had as one of its special
objects the housing and entertainment of the bishop and canons
of St Mary of Bethlehem, the mother-church, on their visits to
England. Its first site was in Bishopsgate Street. It is not
certain when lunatics were first received in Bedlam, but it is
mentioned as a hospital in 1330 and some were there in 1403.
In 1547 it was handed over by Henry VIII. with all its revenues
to the city of London as a hospital for lunatics. With the
exception of one such asylum in Granada, Spain, the Bethlehem
Hospital was the first in Europe. It became famous and afterwards
infamous for the brutal ill-treatment meted out to the
insane (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Insanity</a></span>: <i>Hospital Treatment</i>). In 1675 it was
removed to new buildings in Moorfields and finally to its present
site in St George&rsquo;s Fields, Lambeth. The word &ldquo;Bedlam&rdquo; has
long been used generically for all lunatic asylums.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEDLINGTON,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> an urban district of Northumberland, England,
within the parliamentary borough of Morpeth, 5 m. S.E. of that
town on a branch of the North Eastern railway. Pop. (1901)
18,766. It lies on high ground above the river Blyth, 2½ m.
above its mouth. The church of St Cuthbert shows good
transitional Norman details. Its dedication recalls the transportation
of the body of the saintly bishop of Lindisfarne from
its shrine at Durham by the monks of that foundation to Lindisfarne,
when in fear of attack from William the Conqueror.
They rested here with the coffin. The modern growth of the
town is attributable to the valuable collieries of the neighbourhood,
and to manufactures of nails and chains. It is one of the
most populous mining centres in the county. On the south
bank of the river is the township and urban district of Cowpen
(pop. 17,879), with collieries and glass works; coal is shipped
from this point by river.</p>

<p>Bedlington (Betlingtun) and the hamlets belonging to it were
bought by Cutheard, bishop of Durham, between 900 and 915,
and although locally situated in the county of Northumberland
became part of the county palatine of Durham over which
Bishop Walcher was granted royal rights by William the
Conqueror. When these rights were taken from Cuthbert
Tunstall, bishop of Durham, in 1536, Bedlington among his
other property lost its special privileges, but was confirmed to
him in 1541 with the other property of his predecessors. Together
with the other lands of the see of Durham, Bedlington
was made over to the ecclesiastical commissioners in 1866.
Bedlingtonshire was made part of Northumberland for civil
purposes by acts of parliament in 1832 and 1844.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEDLOE, WILLIAM<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> (1650-1680), English informer, was
born at Chepstow on the 20th of April 1650. He appears to have
been well educated; he was certainly clever, and after coming
to London in 1670 he became acquainted with some Jesuits
and was occasionally employed by them. Calling himself now
Captain Williams, now Lord Gerard or Lord Newport or Lord
Cornwallis, he travelled from one part of Europe to another;
he underwent imprisonments for crime, and became an expert
in all kinds of duplicity. Then in 1678, following the lead of
Titus Gates, he gave an account of a supposed popish plot to
the English government, and his version of the details of the
murder of Sir E.B. Godfrey was rewarded with £500. Emboldened
by his success he denounced various Roman Catholics,
married an Irish lady, and having become very popular lived
in luxurious fashion. Afterwards his fortunes waned, and he
died at Bristol on the 20th of August 1680. His dying depositions,
which were taken by Sir Francis North, chief justice of
the common pleas, revealed nothing of importance. Bedloe
wrote a <i>Narrative and impartial discovery of the horrid Popish
Plot</i> (1679), but all his statements are extremely untrustworthy.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEDMAR, ALPHONSO BELLA CUEVA,<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> <span class="sc">Marquis of</span> (1572-1655),
Spanish diplomatist, became ambassador to the republic
of Venice in 1667. This was a very important position owing
to the amount of information concerning European affairs
which passed through the hands of the representative of Spain.
When Bedmar took up this appointment, Venice had just concluded
an alliance with France, Switzerland and the Netherlands,
to counterbalance the power of Spain, and the ambassador was
instructed to destroy this league. Assisted by the duke of Ossuna,
viceroy of Naples, he formed a plan to bring the city into the power
of Spain, and the scheme was to be carried out on Ascension Day
1618. The plot was, however, discovered; and Bedmar, protected
by his position from arrest, left Venice and went to Flanders
as president of the council. In 1622 he was made a cardinal,
and soon afterwards became bishop of Oviedo, a position which
he retained until his death, which occurred at Oviedo on the
2nd of August 1655. The authorship of an anonymous work,
<i>Squitinio della libertà Veneta</i>, published at Mirandola in 1612,
has been attributed to him.</p>

<p>Some controversy has arisen over the Spanish plot of 1618,
and some historians have suggested that it only existed in the
minds of the Venetian senators, and was a ruse for forcing
Bedmar to leave Venice. From what is known, however, of
the policy of Spain at this time, it is by no means unlikely that
such a scheme was planned.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEDOUINS<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> (<i>Ahl Bedu</i>, &ldquo;dwellers in the open land,&rdquo; or
<i>Ahl el beit</i>, &ldquo;people of the tent,&rdquo; as they call themselves), the
name given to the most important, as it is the best known,
division of the Arab race. The Bedouins are the descendants of
the Arabs of North Arabia whose traditions claim Ishmael as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page623" id="page623"></a>623</span>
their ancestor (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arabs</a></span>). The deserts of North Arabia seem
to have been their earliest home, but even in ancient times they
had migrated to the lowlands of Egypt and Syria. The Arab
conquest of northern Africa in the 7th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> caused
a wide dispersion, so that to-day the Arab element is strongly
represented in the Nile Valley, Saharan, and Nubian peoples.
Among the Hamitic-Negroid races the Bedouins have largely
lost their nomadic character; but in the deserts of the Nile
lands they remain much what their ancestors were. Thus the
name has suffered much ethnic confusion, and is often incorrectly
reserved to describe such pastoral peoples as the Bisharin, the
Hadendoa and the Ababda. This article treats solely of the
Arabian Bedouin, as affording the purest type of the people.
They are shepherds and herdsmen, reduced to an open-air, roving
life, partly by the nature of their occupations, partly by the
special characteristics of the countries in which they dwell. For,
while land, unsuited to all purposes except pasture, forms an
unusually large proportion of the surface in the Arabian territory,
the prolonged droughts of summer render considerable portions
of it unfit even for that, and thus continually oblige the herdsmen
to migrate from one spot to another in search of sufficient
herbage and water for their beasts. The same causes also involve
the Bedouins in frequent quarrels with each other regarding the
use of some particular well or pasture-ground, besides reducing
them not unfrequently to extreme want, and thus making them
plunderers of others in self-support. Professionally, the Bedouins
are shepherds and herdsmen; their raids on each other or their
robbery of travellers and caravans are but occasional exceptions
to the common routine. Their intertribal wars (they very rarely
venture on a conflict with the better-armed and better-organized
sedentary population) are rarely bloody; cattle-lifting
being the usual object. Private feuds exist, but are
usually limited to two or three individuals at most, one of whom
has perhaps been ridiculed in satirical verse, to which they are
very sensitive, or had a relation killed in some previous fray.
But bloodshed is expensive, as it must be paid for either by
more bloodshed or by blood-money&mdash;the <i>diya</i>, which varies,
according to the importance of the person killed, from ten to fifty
camels, or even more. Previous to Mahomet&rsquo;s time it was
optional for the injured tribe either to accept this compensation
or to insist on blood for blood; but the Prophet, though by his
own account despairing of ever reducing the nomad portion of
his countrymen to law and order, succeeded in establishing among
them the rule, that a fair <i>diya</i> if offered must be accepted.
Instances are, however, not wanting in Arab history of fiercer
and more general Bedouin conflicts, in which the destruction,
or at least the complete subjugation, of one tribe has been
aimed at by another, and when great slaughter has taken place.
Such were the wars of Pekr and Thagleb in the 6th century,
of Kelb and Howazin in the 8th, of Harb and Ateba in the 18th.</p>

<p>The Bedouins regard the plundering of caravans or travellers
as in lieu of the custom dues exacted elsewhere. The land is
theirs, they argue, and trespassers on it must pay the forfeit.
Hence whoever can show anything equivalent to a permission
of entrance into their territory has, in the regular course of
things, nothing to fear. This permission is obtained by securing
the protection of the nearest Bedouin sheik, who, for a
politely-worded request and a small sum of money, will readily grant
the pass, in the shape of one or two or more men of his tribe,
who accompany the wayfarers as far as the next encampment on
their road, where they hand their charge over to fresh guides,
equally bound to afford the desired safeguard. In the interior
of Arabia the passport is given in writing by one of the town
governors, and is respected by the Bedouins of the district;
for, however impudent and unamenable to law these nomads
may be on the frontiers of the impotent Ottoman government in
Syria or the Hejaz, they are submissive enough in other and
Arab-governed regions. But the traveller who ventures on the
desert strip without such precautions will be robbed and perhaps
killed.</p>

<p>Ignorant of writing and unacquainted with books, the Bedouins
trust to their memory for everything; where memory fails,
they readily eke it out with imagination. Hence their own
assertions regarding the antiquity, numbers, strength, &amp;c., of
their clans are of little worth; even their genealogies, in which
they pretend to be eminently versed, are not to be much depended
on; the more so that their own family names hardly ever exceed
the limits of a patronymic, whilst the constantly renewed subdivisions
of a tribe, and the temporary increase of one branch
and decrease of another, tend to efface the original name of the
clan. Few tribes now preserve their ancient, or at least their
historical titles; and the mass of the Bedouin multitude resembles
in this respect a troubled sea, of which the substance is
indeed always the same, but the surface is continually shifting
and changing. As, however, no social basis or ties are acknowledged
among them except those of blood and race, certain broad
divisions are tolerably accurately kept up, the wider and more
important of which may here be noted. First, the Aneza clan,
who extend from Syria southward to the limits of Jebel Shammar.
It is numerous, and, for a Bedouin tribe, well armed. Two-thirds
of the Arab horse trade, besides a large traffic in sheep,
camels, wool, and similar articles, are in their hands. Their
principal subdivisions are the Sebaá on the north, the Walid Ali
on the west, and the Ruála on the south; these are generally
on bad terms with each other. If united, they could muster,
it is supposed, about 30,000 lances. They claim descent from
Rabi&rsquo;a. Second, the Shammar Bedouins, whose pasturages lie
conterminous to those of the Aneza on the east. Their numbers
are about the same. Thirdly, in the northern desert, the Huwetat
and Sherarat, comparatively small and savage tribes. There is
also the Solibi clan, which, however, is disowned by the Arabs,
and seems to be of gipsy origin. Next follow, in the western
desert, the Beni-Harb, a powerful tribe, supposed to muster
about 20,000 fighting men. They are often troublesome to the
Meccan pilgrims. In the eastern desert are the Muter, the
Beni-Khalid, and the Ajmans, all numerous clans, often at war with
each other. To the south, in Nejd itself or on its frontiers,
are the Hodeil, Ateba, and others. These all belong to the
&ldquo;Mustareb,&rdquo; or northern Arabs.</p>

<p>The Bedouins of southern or &ldquo;pure Arab&rdquo; origin are comparatively
few in number, and are, with few exceptions, even poorer
and more savage than their northern brethren. Al-Morrah,
on the confines of Oman, Al-Yam and Kahtan, near
Yemen, and Beni-Yas, between Harik and the Persian Gulf,
are the best known. The total number of the Bedouin or
pastoral population throughout Arabia, including men, women,
and children, appears not to exceed a million and a half, or about
one fifth of the total population. The only tribal authority is
the &ldquo;elder,&rdquo; or &ldquo;sheik,&rdquo; a title not necessarily implying
advanced age, but given to any one who, on account of birth,
courage, wealth, liberality or some other quality, has been
chosen to the leadership. Descent has something to do with
rank, but not much, as every individual of the tribe considers
himself equal to the others; nor are the distinctions of relative
riches and poverty greatly taken into account. To the &ldquo;sheik&rdquo;
all disputes are referred; he is consulted, though not necessarily
obeyed, on every question which regards the general affairs of
the tribe, whether in peace or war; there is no other magistrate,
and no law except what he and the other chief men may consider
proper. But in fact, for most personal and private affairs,
every man does pretty much what is right in his own eyes.</p>

<p>All the Bedouins, with the exception of certain tribes in Syria,
are nominally Mahommedans, but most pay but slight attention
to the ceremonial precepts of the Koran; the five daily prayers
and the annual fast of Ramadan are not much in favour among
them; and however near a tribe may be to Mecca, few of them
visit it as pilgrims. The militant Wahhabi have, however, from
time to time enforced some degree of Islamitic observance among
the Bedouins of Nejd and the adjoining districts: elsewhere
Mahommedanism is practically confined to the profession of
the Divine Unity; among the remoter and wilder tribes sun-worship,
tree-worship, and no worship at all, are not uncommon.
Some clans even omit the rite of circumcision altogether; others,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page624" id="page624"></a>624</span>
like the tribe of Hodeil, south of Mecca, perform it after a fashion
peculiar to themselves.</p>

<p>Though polygamy is not common among Bedouins, marriages
are contracted without any legal intervention or guarantee;
the consent of the parties, and the oral testimony of a couple of
witnesses, should such be at hand, are all that are required;
and divorce is equally easy. Nor is mutual constancy much
expected or observed either by men or women; and the husband
is rarely strict in exacting from the wife a fidelity that he himself
has no idea of observing. Jealousy may indeed occasionally bring
about tragic results, but this rarely occurs except where publicity,
to which the Bedouins, like all other Arabs, are very sensitive,
is involved. Burckhardt writes: &ldquo;The Bedouins are jealous of
their women, but do not prevent them from laughing and talking
with strangers. It seldom happens that a Bedouin strikes his
wife; if he does so she calls loudly on her <i>wasy</i> or protector,
who pacifies the husband and makes him listen to reason....
The wife and daughters perform all domestic business. They
grind the wheat in the handmill or pound it in the mortar;
they prepare the breakfast and dinner; knead and bake the
bread; make butter, fetch water, work at the loom, mend the
tent-covering ... while the husband or brother sits before the
tent smoking his pipe.&rdquo; A maiden&rsquo;s honour is, on the other hand,
severely guarded; and even too openly avowed a courtship,
though with the most honourable intentions, is ill looked on.
But marriage, if indeed so slight and temporary a connexion
as it is among Bedouins deserves the name, is often merely a
passport for mutual licence. In other respects Bedouin morality,
like that of most half-savage races, depends on custom and
public feeling rather than on any fixed code or trained conscience,
and hence admits of the strangest contradictions. Not only are
lying and exaggeration no reproach in ordinary discourse, but
even deliberate perjury and violation of the most solemn engagements
are frequent occurrences. Not less frequent, however,
are instances of prolonged fidelity and observance of promise
carried to the limits of romance. &ldquo;The wind,&rdquo; &ldquo;the wood,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the honour of the Arabs&rdquo; are the most ordinary oaths in
serious matters; but even these do not give absolute security,
while a simple verbal engagement will at other times prove an
inviolable guarantee. Thus, too, the extreme abstemiousness
of a Bedouin alternates with excessive gorgings; and, while
the name and deeds of &ldquo;robber&rdquo; are hardly a reproach, those of
&ldquo;thief&rdquo; are marked by abhorrence and contempt. In patience,
or rather endurance, both physical and moral, few Bedouins
are deficient; wariness is another quality universally developed
by their mode of life. And in spite of an excessive coarseness of
language, and often of action, gross vice, at least of the more
debasing sorts that dishonour the East, is rare.</p>

<p>Most Bedouins, men and women, are rather undersized;
their complexion, especially in the south, is dark; their hair
coarse, thick and black; their eyes dark and oval; the nose is
generally aquiline, and the features well formed; the beard and
moustache are usually scanty. The men are active, but not
strong; the women are generally plain. The dress of the men
consists of a long cotton shirt, open at the breast, often girt with
a leathern girdle; a black or striped cloak of hair is sometimes
thrown over the shoulders; a handkerchief, folded once, black,
or striped yellow and red, covers the head, round which it is kept
in its place by a piece of twine or a twisted hairband. To this
costume a pair of open sandals is sometimes added. Under the
shirt, round the naked waist, a thin strip of leather plait is wound
several times, not for any special object, but merely out of
custom. In his hand a Bedouin almost always carries a slight
crooked wand, commonly of almond-wood. Among the Bedouins
of the south a light wrapper takes the place of the handkerchief
on the head, and a loin-cloth that of the shirt. The women
usually wear wide loose drawers, a long shirt, and over it a wide
piece of dark blue cloth enveloping the whole figure and head,
and trailing on the ground behind. Very rarely does a Bedouin
woman wear a veil, or even cover her face with her overcloak,
contenting herself with narrowing the folds of the latter over her
head on the approach of a stranger. Her wrists and ankles are
generally adorned with bracelets and rings of blue glass or
copper or iron, very rarely of silver; her neck with glass beads;
ear-rings are rare, and nose-rings rarer. Boys, till near puberty,
usually go stark naked; girls also wear no clothes up to the age
of six or seven.</p>

<p>On a journey a Bedouin invariably carries with him a light,
sharp-pointed lance, the stem of which is made of Persian or
African cane; the manner in which this is carried or trailed
often indicates the tribe of the owner. The lance is the favourite
and characteristic weapon of the Arab nomad, and the one in the
use of which he shows the greatest skill. An antiquated sword,
an out-of-date musket, an ornamented dagger or knife, a coat of
mail, the manufacture of Yemen or Bagdad, and a helmet, a mere
iron head-piece, without visor or crest, complete his military
outfit.</p>

<p>A Bedouin&rsquo;s tent consists of a few coverings of the coarsest
goat-hair, dyed black, and spread over two or more small poles,
in height from 8 to 9 ft., gipsy fashion. If it be the tent of a
sheik, its total length may be from 30 to 40 ft.; if of an ordinary
person, less than 20 ft. Sometimes a partition separates the
quarters of the women and children; sometimes they are
housed under a lower and narrower covering. A rough carpet
or mat is spread on the ground; while camel-saddles, ropes,
halters, two or three cooking pots, one or two platters, a wooden
drinking bowl, the master&rsquo;s arms at one side of the tent, and his
spear stuck in the ground at the door, complete the list of household
valuables. On striking camp all these are fastened on the
backs of camels; the men mount their saddles, the women their
litters; and in an hour the blackened stones that served for a
cooking hearth are the only sign of the encampment. For food
the Bedouin relies on his herds, but rice, vegetables, honey,
locusts and even lizards are at times eaten.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEDSORE,<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> a form of ulceration or sloughing, occasioned in
people who, through sickness or old age, are confined to bed,
resulting from pressure or the irritation of sweat and dirt.
Bedsores usually occur when there is a low condition of nutrition
of the tissues. The more helpless the patient the more liable he
is to bedsores, and especially when he is paralysed, delirious or
insane, or when suffering from one of the acute specific fevers.
They may occur wherever there is a pressure, more especially
when any moisture is allowed to remain on the bedding; and
thus lack of cleanliness is an important factor in the production
of this condition. In large hospitals a bedsore is now a great
rarity, and this, considering the helplessness of many of the
patients treated, shows what good nursing can do. The bed
must be made with a firm smooth mattress; the undersheet and
blanket must be changed whenever they become soiled; the
drawsheet is spread without creases, and changed the moment it
becomes soiled. Preventive treatment must be followed from
the first day of the illness. This consists in the most minute
attention to cleanliness, and constant variation in the position
of the patient. All parts subjected to pressure or friction must
be frequently washed with soap and hot water, then thoroughly
dried with a warm soft towel. The part should next be bathed
in a solution of corrosive sublimate in spirits of wine, and finally
dusted with an oxide of zinc and starch powder. This routine
should be gone through not less than four times in the twenty-four
hours in any case of prolonged illness. The pressure may be
relieved over bony prominences by a water-pillow or by a piece
of thick felt cut into a ring. Signs of impending bedsores must
constantly be watched for. Where one threatens, the skin loses
its proper colour, becoming either a deadly white or a dusky red,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page625" id="page625"></a>625</span>
and the redness does not disappear on pressure. The surrounding
tissues become oedematous, and pain is often severe, except in a
case of paralysis. As the condition progresses further the pain
ceases. The epidermis now becomes raised as in a blister, and
finally becomes detached, forming an excoriation and exposing
the papillae. Even at this late stage an actual ulceration can
still be prevented if proper care is taken; but failing this, the
skin sloughs and an ulcer forms. In treating this, the position
of the patient must be such that no pressure is ever allowed on the
sloughing tissue. A hot boracic pad under oil-silk should be
applied, the affected part being first dusted with iodoform.
If, however, the slough is very large, it is safer to avoid wet
applications, and the parts should be dusted with animal charcoal
and iodoform, and protected with a dry dressing. When the
slough has separated and the sore is clean, friar&rsquo;s balsam will
hasten the healing process. In any serious illness the formation
of a bedsore makes the prognosis far more grave, and may even
bring about a fatal issue, either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEE<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (Sanskrit <i>bha</i>, A S. <i>beó</i>, Lat. <i>apis</i>), a large and natural
family of the zoological order <i>Hymenoptera</i>, characterized by
the plumose form of many of their hairs, by the large size of
the basal segment of
the foot, which is
always elongate and
in the hindmost limb
sometimes as broad
as the shin, and by
the development of a
&ldquo;tongue&rdquo; for sucking
liquid food; this
organ has been variously
interpreted as
the true insectan
tongue (hypo-pharynx)
or as a
ligula formed by
fused portions of the
second maxillae
(probably the latter).</p>

<p>Bees are specialized
in correspondence
with the flowers from
which they draw the
bulk of their food
supply, the flexible
tongue being used
for sucking nectar,
the plumed hairs and
the modified legs (fig.
7) for gathering pollen.
These floral products
which form the
food of bees and of
their larvae, are in
most cases collected
and stored by the
industrious insects;
but some genera of
bees act as inquilines
or &ldquo;cuckoo-parasites,&rdquo; laying their eggs in the nests of other
bees, so that their larvae may feed at the expense of the
rightful owners of the nest. In a few cases, the parasitic bee-grub
devours not only the food-supply, but also the larva of
its host.</p>

<p><i>Solitary and Social Bees.</i>&mdash;Many genera of bees are represented,
like most other insects, by ordinary males and females, each
female constructing a nest formed of several chambers (&ldquo;cells&rdquo;)
and storing in each chamber a supply of food for the grub to be
hatched from the egg that she lays therein. Such bees, although
a number of individuals often make their nests close together,
are termed &ldquo;solitary,&rdquo; their communities differing in nature
from those of the &ldquo;social&rdquo; bees, among which there are two
kinds of females&mdash;the normal fertile females or &ldquo;queens,&rdquo;
and those specially modified females with undeveloped ovaries
(see fig. 6) that are called &ldquo;workers&rdquo; (fig. 1). The workers
are the earliest developed offspring of the queen, and it is their
associated work which renders possible the rise of an insect
state&mdash;a state which evidently has its origin in the family.
It is interesting to trace various stages in the elaboration of the
bee-society. Among the humble-bees (<i>Bombus</i>) the workers help
the queen, who takes her share in the duties of the nest; the
distinction between queen and workers is therefore less absolute
than in the hive-bees (<i>Apis</i>), whose queen, relieved of all nursing
and building cares by the workers, devotes her whole energies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page626" id="page626"></a>626</span>
to egg-laying. The division of labour among the two castes of
female becomes therefore most complete in the most highly
organized society.</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Structure.</i>&mdash;Details of the structure of bees are given in the
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hymenoptera</a></span>. The feelers (fig. 2, <i>a</i>) are divided into
&ldquo;scape&rdquo; and &ldquo;flagellum&rdquo; as in the ants, and the mandibles
vary greatly in size and sharpness in different genera. The
proboscis or &ldquo;tongue&rdquo; (fig. 2, <i>l</i>) is a hollow organ enclosing
an outgrowth of the body-cavity which is filled with fluid,
and with its flexible under-surface capable of invagination or
protrusion. Along this surface stretches a groove which is surrounded
by thickened cuticle and practically formed into a
tube by numerous fine hairs. Along this channel the nectar is
drawn into the pharynx and passes, mixed with saliva, into the
crop or &ldquo;honey-bag&rdquo;; the action of the saliva changes the
saccharose into dextrose and levulose, and the nectar becomes
honey, which the bee regurgitates for storage in the cells or for
the feeding of the grubs. The sting (fig. 6, <i>pg, st</i>.) of female
bees is usually highly specialized, but in a few genera it is reduced
and useless.</p>

<p>Many modifications in details of structure may be observed
within the family. The tongue is bifid at the tip in a few genera;
usually it is pointed and varies greatly in length, being comparatively
short in <i>Andrena</i>, long in the humble-bees (<i>Bombus</i>),
and longest in <i>Euglossa</i>, a tropical American genus of solitary
bees. The legs, which are so highly modified as pollen-carriers
in the higher bees, are comparatively simple in certain primitive
genera. The hairy covering, so notable in the hive-bee and
especially in humble-bees, is greatly reduced among bees that
follow a parasitic mode of life.</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Early stages</i>.&mdash;As is usual where an abundant food supply
is provided for the young insects, the larvae of bees (fig. 3, SL.)
are degraded maggots; they have no legs, but possess fairly
well-developed heads. The successive cuticles that are cast
as growth proceeds are delicate in texture and sometimes
separate from the underlying cuticle without being stripped
off. The maggots may pass no excrement from the intestine
until they have eaten all their store of food. When fully grown
the final larval cuticle is shed, and the &ldquo;free&rdquo; pupa (fig. 3, N)
revealed. The larvae of some bees spin cocoons (fig. 3, <i>co</i>)
before pupation.</p>

<p><i>Nests of Solitary Bees</i>.&mdash;Bees of different genera vary considerably
in the site and arrangement of their nests. Many&mdash;like
the common &ldquo;solitary&rdquo; bees <i>Halictus</i> and <i>Andrena</i>&mdash;burrow
in the ground; the holes of species of <i>Andrena</i> are commonly
seen in springtime opening on sandy banks, grassy lawns or
gravel paths. Our knowledge of such bees is due to the observations
of F. Smith, H. Friese, C. Verhoeff and others. The nest
may be simple, or, more frequently, a complex excavation, cells
opening off from the entrance or from a main passage. Sometimes
the passage is the conjoint work of many bees whose cells
are grouped along it at convenient distances apart. Other bees,
the species of <i>Osmia</i> for example, choose the hollow stem of a
bramble or other shrub, the female forming a linear series of cells
in each of which an egg is laid and a supply of food stored up.
J.H. Fabre has found that in the nests of some species of <i>Osmia</i>
the young bee developed in the first-formed cell, if (as often
happens) she emerges from her cocoon before the inmates of
the later cells, will try to work her way round these or to bite
a lateral hole through the bramble shoot; should she fail to
do this, she will wait for the emergence of her sisters and not
make her escape at the price of injury to them. But when
Fabre substituted dead individuals of her own species or live
larvae of another genus, the <i>Osmia</i> had no scruple in destroying
them, so as to bite her way out to air and liberty.</p>

<p>The leaf-cutter bees (<i>Megachile</i>)&mdash;which differ from <i>Andrena</i>
and <i>Halictus</i> and agree with <i>Osmia</i>, <i>Apis</i> and <i>Bombus</i> in having
elongate tongues&mdash;cut neat circular disks from leaves, using
them for lining the cells of their underground nests. The
carpenter-bees (<i>Xylocopa</i> and allied genera), unrepresented
in the British Islands, though widely distributed in warmer
countries, make their nests in dry wood. The habits of <i>X.
violacea</i>, the commonest European species, were minutely
described in the 18th century in one of R.A.F. de Réaumur&rsquo;s
memoirs. This bee excavates several parallel galleries to which
access is gained by a cylindrical hole. In the galleries are
situated the cells, separated from one another by transverse
partitions, which are formed of chips of wood, cemented by
the saliva of the bee.</p>

<p>Among the solitary bees none has more remarkable nesting
habits than the mason bee (<i>Chalicodoma</i>) represented in the
south of France and described at length by Fabre. The female
constructs on a stone a series of cells, built of cement, which
she compounds of particles of earth, minute stones and her
own saliva. Each cell is provided with a store of honey and
pollen beside which an egg is laid; and after eight or nine cells
have been successively built and stored, the whole is covered
by a dome-like mass of cement. Fabre found that a <i>Chalicodoma</i>
removed to a distance of 4 kilometres from the nest that she was
building, found her way back without difficulty to the exact
spot. But if the nest were removed but a few yards from its
former position, the bee seemed no longer able to recognize it,
sometimes passing over it, or even into the unfinished cell, and
then leaving it to visit again uselessly the place whence it had
been moved. She would accept willingly, however, another
nest placed in the exact spot where her own had been. If the
unfinished cell in the old nest had been only just begun, while
that in the substituted nest were nearly completed, the bee
would add so much material as to make the cell much larger
than the normal size, her instinct evidently being to do a certain
amount of building work before filling the cell with food. The
food, too, is always placed in the cell after a fixed routine&mdash;first
honey disgorged from the mouth, then pollen brushed off the
hairs beneath the body (fig. 7, <i>c</i>) after which the two substances
are mixed into a paste.</p>

<p><i>Inquilines and Parasites</i>.&mdash;The working bees, such as have been
mentioned, are victimized by bees of other genera, which throw
upon the industrious the task of providing for the young of
the idle. The nests of <i>Andrena</i>, for example, are haunted by
the black and yellow species of <i>Nomada</i>, whose females lay their
eggs in the food provided for the larva of the <i>Andrena</i>. According
to H. Friese, the relations between the host and the inquiline
are quite friendly, and the insects if they meet in the nest-galleries
courteously get out of each other&rsquo;s way. D. Sharp,
in commenting on this strange behaviour, points out that the
host can have no idea why the inquiline haunts her nest. &ldquo;Why
then should the <i>Andrena</i> feel alarm? If the species of <i>Nomada</i>
attack the species of <i>Andrena</i> too much, it brings about the
destruction of its own species more certainly than that of the
<i>Andrena</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More violent in its methods is the larva of a <i>Stelis</i>, whose
operations in the nest of <i>Osmia leucomelana</i> have been studied
by Verhoeff. The female <i>Stelis</i> lays her eggs earlier than the
<i>Osmia</i>, and towards the bottom of the food-mass; the egg of
the <i>Osmia</i> is laid later, and on the surface of the food. Hence
the two eggs are at opposite ends of the food, and both larvae
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page627" id="page627"></a>627</span>
feed for a time without conflict, but the <i>Stelis</i>, being the older,
is the larger of the two. Finally the parasitic larva attacks
the <i>Osmia</i>, and digging its mandibles into its victim&rsquo;s head
kills and eats it, taking from one to two days for the completion
of the repast.</p>

<p><i>Social Bees</i>.&mdash;The bees hitherto described are &ldquo;solitary,&rdquo;
all the individuals being either males or unmodified females.
The most highly developed of the long-tongued bees are &ldquo;social&rdquo;
species, in which
the females are
differentiated
into egg-laying
queens and
(usually) infertile
&ldquo;workers&rdquo;
(fig. 6). Verhoeff
has discussed
the rise of the
&ldquo;social&rdquo; from
the &ldquo;solitary&rdquo;
condition, and
points out that
for the formation
of an insect
community three
conditions are necessary&mdash;a nest large enough for a number
of individuals, a close grouping of the cells, and an association
between mother and daughters in the winged state.
For the fulfilment of this last condition, the older insects of the
new generation must emerge from the cells while the mother is
still occupied with the younger eggs or larvae. One species of
<i>Halictus</i> nearly reaches the desired stage; but the first young
bees to appear in the perfect state are males, and when the
females emerge the mother dies.</p>

<p>Among the social bees the mother and daughter-insects
co-operate, and they differ from the &ldquo;solitary&rdquo; groups in the
nature of their nest, the cells (fig. 25) of which are formed of
wax secreted by special glands (fig. 5) in the bee&rsquo;s abdomen,
the wax being pressed out between the segmental sclerites in
the form of plates (fig. 4), which are worked by the legs (fig. 7)
and jaws into the requisite shape. In our well-known hive-bee
(<i>Apis</i>) and humble-bees (<i>Bombus</i>) the wax glands are ventral
in position, but in the &ldquo;stingless&rdquo; bees of the tropics (<i>Trigona</i>
and <i>Melipona</i>) they are dorsal. A colony of humble-bees is
started in spring by a female &ldquo;queen&rdquo; which has survived the
winter. She starts her nest underground or in a surface depression,
forming a number of waxen cells, roughly globular in shape
and arranged irregularly. The young females (&ldquo;workers&rdquo;)
that develop from the eggs laid in these early cells assist the
queen by building fresh cells and gathering food for storage
therein. The queen may be altogether relieved of the work
of the nest as the season advances, so that she can devote all
her energies to egg-laying, and the colony grows rapidly. The
distinction between queen and worker is not always clear among
humble-bees, the female insects varying in size and in the development
of their ovaries. If any mishap befall the queen, the workers
can sometimes keep the community from dying out. In autumn
males are produced, as well as young queens. The community
is broken up on the approach of winter, the males and workers
perish, and the young queens after hibernation start fresh nests
in the succeeding year.</p>

<p>The appearance of the heavy-bodied hairy <i>Bombi</i> is well

<i>virginalis</i> form of
<i>Bombus terrestris</i>
often invades a nest
belonging to the
<i>lucorum</i> form, kills
the rightful queen,
and takes possession
of the nest, getting
the <i>lucorum</i> workers
to rear her young.
In the nests of
<i>Bombi</i> are found
various beetle
larvae that live as
inquilines or parasites,
and also maggots
of drone-flies
(<i>Volucella</i>), which
act as scavengers;
the Volucella-fly is
usually a &ldquo;mimic&rdquo; of the <i>Bombus</i>, whose nest she invades.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;stingless&rdquo; bees (<i>Trigona</i>) of the tropics have the parts
of the sting reduced and useless for piercing. As though to
compensate for the loss of this means of defence, the mandibles
are very powerful, and some of the bees construct tubular
entrances to the nest with a series of constrictions easy to hold
against an enemy. The habits of the Brazilian species of these
bees have been described in detail by H. von Jhering, who points
out that their wax glands are dorsal in position, not ventral as
in <i>Bombus</i> and <i>Apis</i>.</p>

<p>With <i>Apis</i>, the genus of the hive-bee, we come to the most
highly-specialized members of the family&mdash;better known, perhaps
than any other insects, on account of the long domestication of
many of the species or races. In <i>Apis</i> the workers differ structurally
from the queen, who neither builds cells, gathers food, nor
tends brood, and is therefore without the special organs adapted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page628" id="page628"></a>628</span>
for those functions which are possessed in perfection by the
workers. The differentiation of queen and workers is correlated
with the habit of storing food supplies, and the consequent
permanence of the community, which finds relief for its surplus
population by sending off a swarm, consisting of a queen and a
number of workers, so that the new community is already
specialized both for reproduction and for labour.</p>

<p>The workers of <i>Apis</i> may be capable (fig. 6, C) of laying
eggs&mdash;necessarily unfertilized&mdash;which always give rise to males
(&ldquo;drones&rdquo;), and, since the researches of J. Dzierzon (1811-1906)
in 1848, it has been believed that the queen bee lays
fertilized eggs in cells appropriate for the rearing of queens or
workers, and unfertilized eggs in &ldquo;drone-cells,&rdquo; virgin reproduction
or parthenogenesis being therefore a normal factor in the
life of these insects. F. Dickel and others have lately claimed
that fertilized eggs can give rise to either queens, workers or
males, according to the food supplied to the larvae and the
influence of supposed &ldquo;sex-producing glands&rdquo; possessed by
the nurse-workers. Dickel states that a German male bee
mated with a female of the Italian race transmits distinct
paternal characters to hybrid male offspring. A. Weismann,
however, doubts these conclusions, and having found a spermaster
in every one of the eggs that he examined from worker-cells,
and in only one out of 272 eggs taken from drone-cells,
he supports Dzierzon&rsquo;s view, explaining the single exception
mentioned above as a mistake of the queen, she having laid
inadvertently this single fertilized egg in a drone instead of in a
worker cell.</p>

<p>The cells of the honeycomb of <i>Apis</i> are usually hexagonal in
form, and arranged in two series back to back (figs. 3, 25).
Some of these cells are used for storage, others for the rearing of
brood. The cells in which workers are reared are smaller than
those appropriate for the rearing of drones, while the &ldquo;royal
cells,&rdquo; in which the young queens are developed, are large in
size and of an irregular oval in form (fig. 25). It is believed that
from the nature of the cell in which she is ovipositing, the queen
derives a reflex impulse to lay the appropriate egg&mdash;fertilized
in the queen or worker cell, unfertilized in the drone cell, as
previously mentioned. Whether the fertilized egg shall develop
into a queen or a worker depends upon the nature of the food.
All young grubs are at first fed with a specially nutritious food,
discharged from the worker&rsquo;s stomach, to which is added a digestive
secretion derived from special salivary glands in the worker&rsquo;s
head. If this &ldquo;royal jelly&rdquo; continue to be given to the grub
throughout its life, it will grow into a queen; if the ordinary
mixture of honey and digested pollen be substituted, as is
usually the case from the fourth day, the grub will become a
worker. The workers, who control the polity of the hive (the
&ldquo;queen&rdquo; being exceedingly &ldquo;limited&rdquo; in her monarchy),
arrange if possible that young queens shall develop only when
the population of the hive has become so congested that it is
desirable to send off a swarm. When a young queen has emerged,
she stings her royal sisters (still in the pupal stage) to death.
Previous to the emergence of the young queen, the old queen,
prevented by the workers from attacking her daughters, has led
off a swarm to find a new home elsewhere. The young queen,
left in the old home, mounts high into the air for her nuptial
flight, and then returns to the hive and her duties of egg-laying.
The number of workers increases largely during the summer,
and so hard do the insects work that the life of an individual
may last only a few weeks. On the approach of winter the
males, having no further function to perform for the community,
are refused food-supplies by the workers, and are either excluded
or banished from the hive to perish. Such ruthless habits of the
bee-commonwealth, no less than the altruistic labours of the
workers, are adapted for the survival and dominance of the
species. The struggle for life may deal hardly with the individual,
but it results&mdash;to quote Darwin&rsquo;s well-known title&mdash;in
&ldquo;the preservation of favoured races.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bee-keeping, or the cultivation of the honey-bee as a source
of income to those who practise it, is known to have existed
from the most ancient times. Poets, philosophers, historians
and naturalists (among whom may be mentioned Virgil, Aristotle,
Cicero and Pliny) have eulogized the bee as unique among
insects, endowed by nature with wondrous gifts beneficial to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page629" id="page629"></a>629</span>
mankind in a greater degree than any other creature of the
insect world. We are told that some of these ancient scientists
passed years of their lives studying the wonders of bee-life, and
left accurate records of their observations, which on many points
agree with the investigations of later observers. As a forcible
illustration of the manner in which a colony of bees was recognized
as the embodiment of government by a chief or ruler, in the
earliest times of which there is any existing record, it may be
mentioned that on the sarcophagus containing the mummified
remains of Mykerinos (now in the British
Museum and dating back 3633 years <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)
will be found a hieroglyphic bee, (fig. 8)
representing the king of Lower Egypt.</p>

<p>In dealing with the practical side of bee-keeping
as now understood, it may be said
that, compared with the methods in vogue
during the first decade of the 19th century,
or even within the memory of men still
living at the beginning of the 20th, it
is as the modern locomotive to the stagecoach
of a previous generation. Almost
everything connected with bee-craft has been revolutionized,
and apiculture, instead of being classed with such homely
rural occupations as that of the country housewife who carries a
few eggs weekly to the market-town in her basket, is to-day
regarded in many countries as a pursuit of considerable importance.
<span class="sidenote">Queen-rearing.</span>
Remarkable progress has also been made in the art of queen-rearing,
and in improving the common or native bee by judicious crossing
with the best foreign races, selected mainly for hardiness, working
qualities and the prolific capacity of their queens. American
bee-breeders are conspicuous in this respect, extensive apiaries
being exclusively devoted to the business of rearing queens by the thousand
for sale and export.</p>

<p>On the European continent queen-rearing apiaries are plentiful,
but less attention is paid there to hybridizing than to keeping the
respective races pure. In England also, some bee-keepers include
queen-rearing as part of their business, while one large apiary
on the south coast is exclusively devoted to the rearing of queen
bees on the latest scientific system, and to breeding by selection
from such races as are most suited to the exceptional climatic
conditions of the country.</p>

<p>Extensive apiaries have been established on the American
continent, some containing from 2000 to 3500 colonies of bees,
and in these honey is harvested in hundreds of tons yearly.
The magnitude of the bee industry in the United States may be
judged from the fact of a single bee-farmer located in California
having harvested from 150,000 &#8468; of honey in one year from
2000 stocks of bees, and, as an instance of the enormous weight
of honey obtainable from good hives in that favoured region, the
same farmer secured 60,000 &#8468; of comb-honey in one season from
his best 300 colonies. This is probably the maximum, and the
hives were necessarily located in separate apiaries some few
miles apart in order to avoid the evils of overstocking, but all
in the midst of thousands of acres of honey-yielding flowers.
Results like the above compared with those of the skeppist bee-keeper
of former days, who was well pleased with an average
of 20 to 25 &#8468; per hive, may be regarded as wonderful, but
<span class="sidenote">Honey as food. </span>
they are matters of fact.  The consumption of honey as an article
of food has also largely increased of late
years; a recent computation shows that from 100 to
125 million &#8468; of honey, representing a money value of from
eight to ten million dollars, is consumed annually in the United
States alone. Many of the larger bee-farmers of the United
States of America and Canada harvest from 50,000 to 60,000 &#8468;
of honey in a single season, and some of them sell the whole
crop direct to consumers.</p>

<p>It is a notable fact that in the United States, Canada, Australia,
New Zealand, and indeed all English-speaking countries outside
the United Kingdom, honey is far more extensively used than
it is there as an article of daily food. The natural result of this
is that the trade in honey is conducted, in those countries, on
entirely different lines from those followed in the British Isles,
where honey production as an occupation has, until quite recent
years, been regarded as too insignificant for official notice in any
<span class="sidenote">State aid for bee-keeping.</span>
form. The value of the bee industry is now recognized,
however, by the British government as worthy of state
aid, in the promotion of technical instruction connected
with agriculture. On the American continent apiculture
is officially recognized by the respective states&rsquo; governments;
and by the federal government at Washington it is taken into
account as a section of the Agricultural Department, with fully
equipped experimental apiaries and qualified professors engaged
therein for educational work. In several Canadian provinces
also, the public funds are used in promoting the bee industry in
various ways, mainly in combating the bee-disease known as
&ldquo;foul brood.&rdquo; In New Zealand the government of the colony
has displayed the most praiseworthy earnestness and vigour in
promoting apiculture. State-aided apiaries have been established
under the supervision of a skilled bee-keeper, who travels over
the colony giving instruction in practical bee-work at the public
schools, and forming classes at various centres where pupils are
taught bee-keeping in all its branches.</p>

<p>In Europe similar progress is observable; technical schools,
with well-equipped apiaries attached, are supported by the
state, and in them the science and practice of modern bee-keeping
is taught free by scientists and practical experts. Institutions
of this kind have been established in Germany, Russia,
Switzerland and elsewhere, all tending in the same direction,
viz. the cultivation of the honey-bee as an appreciable source of
income to the farmer, the peasant cultivator, and dwellers in
districts where bee-forage is abundant and, if unvisited by the
bee, lies wasting its sweetness on the desert air. It may be
safely said that the value of the bee to the fruit-grower and the
market-gardener has been proved beyond dispute; and the
technical instruction now afforded by county councils in the rural
<span class="sidenote">Value of bees as fertilizers.</span>
districts of England has an appreciable effect. In proof
thereof, we may quote the case of an extensive grower
in the midland counties&mdash;sending fruit to the London
market in tons&mdash;whose crop of gooseberries increased
nearly fourfold after establishing a number of stocks of bees in
close proximity to the gooseberry bushes. The fruit orchards
and raspberry fields of Kent are also known to be greatly benefited
by the numerous colonies of bees owned by more than 3000
bee-keepers in the county. The important part played by the
bee in the economy of nature as a fertilizer is shown in fig. 9.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom the prevailing conditions, climatic
and otherwise, with regard to apiculture&mdash;as well as the lack of
sufficient natural bee-forage for large apiaries&mdash;are such as to
preclude the possibility of establishing apiaries on a scale comparable
with those located in less confined lands. On the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page630" id="page630"></a>630</span>
hand, even in England the value of bee-keeping is worthy of
recognition as a minor industry connected with such items of
agriculture as fruit-growing, market-gardening or poultry-raising.
The fact that British honey is second to none for
quality, and that the British market is eagerly sought by the
bee-keepers of other nationalities, has of late impressed itself
on the minds of thinking men. Moreover, their views are confirmed
by the constant references to bees and the profits obtainable
from bee-keeping in the leading papers on all sides. This
newly-aroused interest in the subject is no doubt to a large extent
fostered by the grants in aid of technical instruction afforded by
<span class="sidenote">Bee-keepers&rsquo; associations.</span>
county councils in rural districts. The British Bee-keepers&rsquo;
Association (instituted in 1874) has been
untiring in its efforts to raise the standard of efficiency
among those who are desirous of qualifying as experts
and teachers of bee-keeping on modern methods. This body had
for its first president the distinguished naturalist Sir John
Lubbock (Lord Avebury). Subsequently the baroness Burdett-Coutts
accepted the office in the year 1878, and was re-elected
annually until her death in 1906. During this time she presided
at its meetings and took an active part in its work, until advancing
years prevented her attendance, but her interest in the
welfare of the association was maintained to the last. Branch
societies of bee-keepers were established throughout the English
counties, mainly by the efforts of the parent body in London,
with the object of securing co-operation in promoting the sale
<span class="sidenote">Bee and honey shows.</span>
of honey, and showing the most modern methods of
producing it in its most attractive form at exhibitions
held for the purpose. Nearly the whole of these county
societies affiliated with the central association, paying
an affiliation fee yearly, and receiving in return the silver medal,
bronze medal and certificate of the association, to be offered as
prizes for competition at the annual county shows. Other advantages
are given in connexion with the qualifying of experts,
&amp;c., while nearly all the county associations in the United
Kingdom employ qualified men who visit members in spring
and autumn for the purpose of examining hives and giving
advice on bee management to those needing it. Another
<span class="sidenote">Honey labels.</span>
advantage of membership is the use of a &ldquo;county
label&rdquo; for affixing to each section of honey in comb,
or jar of extracted honey, offered for sale by members.
These labels are numbered consecutively, and thus afford a
guarantee of the genuineness and quality of the honey, the label
enabling purchasers to trace the producer if needed. The
British Bee-keepers&rsquo; Association is an entirely philanthropic
body, the only object of its members being to promote all that
is good in British bee-keeping, and to &ldquo;teach humanity to that
industrious little labourer, the honey-bee.&rdquo; Bee-appliance
manufacturers are not eligible for membership of its council,
nor are those who make bee-keeping their main business; thus
no professional jealousies can possibly arise. In this respect the
association appears to stand alone among the bee-keepers&rsquo;
societies of the world. There are many equally beneficial
societies, framed on different lines, existing in Germany, France,
Russia and Switzerland, but they are mainly co-operative bodies
instituted for the general benefit of members, who are without
exception either bee-keepers on a more or less extensive scale,
or scientists interested in the study of insect life.</p>

<p>The bee-keepers&rsquo; associations of the United States, Canada
and most of the British colonies, are&mdash;like those last mentioned
above&mdash;formed for the sole and laudable purpose of promoting
the business interests of their members, the latter being either
bee-farmers or bee-appliance manufacturers. Thus they make
no pretension of any but business discussions at their conferences,
and much benefit to all concerned follows as a matter of
course. In fact, we find enthusiastic bee-men and women
travelling several hundreds of miles and devoting time, money
and labour in attending conferences of bee-keepers in America,
while the proceedings usually last for several days and are
largely attended. The extent of the industry compared with
that of Great Britain is so great that it fully accounts for the
difference in procedure of the respective associations.</p>

<p>As a natural consequence of this activity, the trade in bee-appliance
making has assumed enormous proportions in the
United States, where extensive factories have been
established; one firm&mdash;employing over 500 hands,
<span class="sidenote">The bee-appliance trade.</span>
and using electric-power machinery of the most modern
type&mdash;being devoted entirely to the manufacture of
bee-goods and apiarian requisites. From this establishment
alone the yearly output is about 25,000 bee-hives, and upwards
of 100 millions of the small wooden boxes used for holding comb-honey.
The most
generally approved
form of this box is
known as the
&ldquo;1-&#8468; section,&rdquo;
made from a strip
of wood ½ in. thick,
2 in. wide, and of
such length that
when folded by
joining the morticed

forms the section of
box C, measuring
4¼&Prime; × 4½&Prime; × 2&Prime; when
complete, and holds
about 1 &#8468; of comb-honey when filled by the bees and ready
for table use. The V-shaped groove D (cut across and partly
through the wood) shows the joint when in the flat, and E the
same joint when closed for use. All the section boxes used in
the United Kingdom are made in the U.S.A or in Canada from
the timber known as basswood, no native wood being suitable
for the purpose.</p>

<p><i>Development of the Movable-frame Hive</i>&mdash;The dome-shaped
straw skep of our forefathers may be regarded as the typical
bee-hive of all time and of all civilized countries;
indeed, it may with truth be said that as a healthy
<span class="sidenote">The straw skep.</span>
and convenient home for the honey-bee it has no equal.
A swarm of bees hived in a straw skep, the picturesque little
domicile known the world over as the personification of industry,
will furnish their home with waxen combs in form and shape so
admirably adapted to their requirements as to need no improvement
by man. Why the circular form was chosen for the skep
need not be inquired into, beyond saying that its shape conforms
to that of a swarm, as the bees usually hang clustered on the
branch of a neighbouring tree or bush after issuing from the
parent hive. Fig 11 shows a straw skep in section, and explains
itself as illustrating the admirable way in which the bees furnish
their dwelling. The vertical section (A) shows the lower portion
of the combs devoted to brood-rearing, the higher and thicker
combs being reserved for honey, and midway between the brood
and food is stored the pollen required for mixing with honey in
feeding the larvae. It will be seen how well the upper part of
the combs are fitted for bearing the weight of stores they contain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page631" id="page631"></a>631</span>
and how the lower portion allows the bees to cluster around the
tender larvae and thus maintain the warmth necessary during its
metamorphosis from the egg to the perfect insect. The horizontal
section (B) with equal clearness demonstrates the bee&rsquo;s
ingenuity in economizing space, showing how the outer combs
are used exclusively for stores, and, as such, may be built of
varying thickness as more or less storage room is required. The
straw skep has, however, the irredeemable fault of fixed combs,
<span class="sidenote">The movable-frame hive.</span>
and the gradual development of the movable-frame
hive of today may be said to have first appeared in
1789 with the leaf-hive of Huber, so called from its
opening like the leaves of a book. Prior to that date
wooden box-hives of various shapes had been adopted by
advanced bee-masters anxious to increase their output of honey,
and by enthusiastic naturalists desirous of studying and investigating
the wonders of bee-life apart from the utilitarian
standpoint. Foremost among the latter was the distinguished
Swiss naturalist and bee-keeper, François Huber, who was led
to construct the leaf-hive bearing his name after experimenting
with a single comb observatory hive recommended by Réaumur.
Huber found that although he could induce swarms to occupy
the glass-sided single frame advised by Réaumur, if the frame
was fitted with ready-built pieces of comb patched together
before hiving the swarm, the experiment was successful, while
if left to themselves the bees built small combs across the space
between the sheets of glass, and the desired inspection from the
outside was thus rendered impossible. He also gathered that the
abnormal conditions forced upon the bees by a ready-built single
comb might so turn aside their natural instincts as to render his
investigations less trustworthy than if conducted under perfectly
natural conditions; so, in order to remove all doubt, he decided
to have a series of wooden frames made, measuring 12 in. sq.,
each of rather more than the ordinary width allowed for brood-combs.
These frames were numbered consecutively 1 to 12,
and hinged together as shown in fig. 12 (<i>h</i>, A). In this way the
frames of comb could be opened for inspection like a book, while
when closed the bees clustered together as in an ordinary hive.
Ten of these frames had a small piece of comb fixed to the top-bar
in each, supported (temporarily) by a thin lath wedged up
with pegs at side, the latter being removed when the comb had
been made secure by the bees. When closed, the ten frames,
together with the two outside ones (fitted with squares of glass
for inspection), which represent the covers of the book, were tied
together with a couple of stout strings. In a subsequent form
of the same hive Huber was enabled&mdash;with the help of very long
thumb-screws at each side (fig. 13)&mdash;to raise up any frame
<span class="sidenote">Huber&rsquo;s observatory hive.</span>
between two sheets of glass which confined the bees
and allowed him to study the process of comb-building
better than any hive we know of today. By means
of the leaf-hive and using the entrances (fig. 12, <i>e, e</i>, A)
Huber made artificial swarms by dividing and the use of division-boards,
though not in quite the same fashion as is practised at
the present day. On the other hand, it must be admitted that
Huber&rsquo;s hive was defective in many respects; the parting of
each frame, thus letting loose the whole colony, caused much
trouble at times, but it remained the only movable-comb hive
till 1838, when Dr Dzierzon&mdash;whose theory of parthenogenesis
has made his name famous&mdash;devised a box-hive with a loose
top-bar on which the bees built their combs and a movable side
or door, by means of which the frames could be lifted out for
inspection. This improvement was at once appreciated, and in
the year 1852 Baron Berlepsch added side-bars and a bottom-bar,
thus completing the movable frame.</p>

<p>About the same time the Rev. L.L. Langstroth was experimenting
on the same lines in America, and in 1852 his important
invention was made known, giving to the world of
bee-keepers a movable frame which in its most important
<span class="sidenote">Laagstroth&rsquo;s hive.</span>
details will never be excelled. We refer to the
respective distances left between the side-bars and hive walls
on each side, and between the lower edge of the bottom-bars
and the floor-board. Langstroth, in his measurements, hit upon
the happy mean which keeps bees from propolizing or fastening
the frames to the hive body, as they assuredly would do if
sufficient space had not been allowed for free passage round the
side-bars; it is equally certain that if too much space had been
provided, they would fill it with comb and thus render the frame
immovable. In addition to these benefits, Langstroth&rsquo;s frame
and hive possessed the enormous advantage over Dzierzon&rsquo;s of
being manipulated from above, so that any single frame could
be raised for inspection without disturbing the others. Langstroth&rsquo;s
space-measurements have remained practically unaltered
notwithstanding the many improvements in hive-making, and
in the various sizes of movable frames, since introduced and used
in different parts of the world.</p>

<p>In the United States of America Langstroth&rsquo;s frame and hive
are the acknowledged &ldquo;standards&rdquo; among the great body of
bee-keepers, although about a dozen different frames,
varying more or less in size, have their adherents.
<span class="sidenote">Size of frames in the U.S.A.</span>
Among these may be named the American, Adair,
Danzenbaker, Gallup, Heddon, Langstroth and
Quinby. Three of these, the American, Adair and Gallup, may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page632" id="page632"></a>632</span>
be termed square frames, the others being oblong, but the latter
shape appears to possess the most all-round advantages to the
modern bee-keeper. Amid the different climatic conditions of so
vast a continent as America, variation in size, and in the capacity
of frames used, is in some measure accounted for.</p>

<p>In the British Isles, though the conditions are variable enough,
they are less extreme, and, fortunately for those engaged in
the pursuit, only one size of frame is acknowledged by
the great majority of bee-keepers, viz. the British
<span class="sidenote">British &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; frame.</span>
Bee-keepers&rsquo; Association &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; (fig. 14). This
frame, the outside measurement of which is 14 by 8½
in., was the outcome of deliberations extending over a considerable
time on the part of a committee of well-known bee-keepers,
specially appointed in 1882 to consider the matter. In this way,
whatever type or form of
hive is used, the frames
are interchangeable.
Differences in view may,
and do, exist regarding
the thickness of the wood
used in frame-making, but
the <i>outside</i> measurement
never varies. Notwithstanding
this fact, the advancement
of apiculture
and the continuous development of the modern frame-hive and
methods of working have proceeded with such rapidity, both
in England and in America, that hives and appliances used
prior to 1885 are now obsolete.</p>

<p>It may, therefore, be useful to compare the progress made
in the United States of America and in Great Britain in order to
show that, while the industry is incomparably larger and of
more importance in America and Canada than in Great Britain,
British bee-keepers have been abreast of the times in all things
apicultural. The original Langstroth hive was single-walled,
held ten frames (size 17¾ by 9 in.), and had a deep roof, made
to cover a case of small honey boxes like the sections now in
use; but the cumbersome projecting porch and sides, made to
support the roof, are now dispensed with, and the number of
frames reduced to eight. Although various modifications have
since been made in minor details&mdash;all tending to improvement&mdash;
its main features are unaltered. The typical hive of America is
the <i>improved</i> Langstroth (fig. 15), which has no other
covering for the frame tops
but a flat roof-board
allowing ¼ in. space
between the roof and
top-bars for bees to
pass from frame to
frame. Consequently,
on the roof being raised
the bees can take wing
if not prevented from
doing so. This feature
finds no favour with
British bee-keepers,
nevertheless the &ldquo;improved
Langstroth&rdquo; is
a useful and simple
hive, moderate in price,
and no doubt efficient, but not suitable for bees wintered on their
summer stands, as nearly all hives are in Great Britain. American bee-keepers,
<span class="sidenote">Winter cellars for bees.</span>
therefore, find it necessary to provide
underground cellars, into which the bees are carried
in the fall of each year, remaining there till work
begins in the following spring. Those among them
who cannot, for various reasons, adopt the cellar-wintering plan
are obliged to provide what are termed &ldquo;chaff-covers&rdquo; for
protecting their bees in winter. Of late years they have also
introduced, as an improvement, the plan long followed in
England of using double-walled chaff-packed hives. The difference
here is that packing is now dispensed with, it being found
that bees winter equally well with an outer case giving 1½ in.
of free space on all sides of the hive proper, but with no packing
in between. Thus no change is needed in winter or summer,
the air-space protecting the bees from cold in winter and heat
in summer. Another point of difference between the English
and American hive is the roof, which being gable-shaped in the
former allows warm packing to be placed directly on the frame
tops, so that the bees are covered in when the roof is removed
and may be examined or fed with very little disturbance. Again,
the American hive is, as a general rule, set close down on the
ground, while stands or short legs are invariably used in Great
Britain. One of the best-known hives in England is that known
as the W.B.C. hive, devised in 1890 by W. Broughton Carr.</p>

<p>Figs. 16 and 17 explain its construction and, as will be seen,
it is equally suitable
when working
for comb or
for extracted
honey.</p>

<p>Various causes
have contributed
to the development
of the modern hive, the
most important
of which are the
improvements in
methods of extracting
honey
from combs, and
in the manufacture of comb-foundation.
Regarding
the first
of these, it cannot
be said that
the honey extractor,
even in its latest form, differs very much from the original
machine (fig. 18) invented by Major Hruschka, an officer in
the Italian army, who in later life became an enthusiastic apiculturist.
<span class="sidenote">Honey extractors.</span>
Hruschka&rsquo;s extractor, first brought to public notice in
1865, may be said to have revolutionized the bee-industry
as a business. It enabled the honey producer to increase
his output considerably by extracting honey from the cells
in most cleanly
fashion without
damaging the
combs, and in a
fraction of the time
previously occupied
in the draining,
heating and squeezing process. At
the same time the
combs were preserved
for refilling
by the bees, in lieu
of melting them
down for wax. The
principle of the
honey extractor
(throwing the
liquid honey out of
the cells by centrifugal
force) was
discovered quite by
accident. Major
Hruschka&rsquo;s little son chanced to have in his hand a bit
of unsealed comb-honey in a basket to which was attached
a piece of string, and, as the boy playfully whirled the basket
round in the air, his father noticed a few drops of honey,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page633" id="page633"></a>633</span>
thrown out of the comb by the centrifugal force employed to
keep the basket suspended. The value of the idea at once struck
him, he set to work on utilizing the principle involved, and
ere long had constructed a machine admirably adapted to serve
its purpose. Since that time changes, of more or less value, have
been introduced to meet present-day requirements.
One of the first to take advantage
of Hruschka&rsquo;s
invention was Mr A. I. Root,
who in 1869 perfected a
machine on similar lines to
the Hruschka one but
embodying various improvements.
This appliance,
known as the &ldquo;Novice Honey
Extractor,&rdquo; became very
popular in the United States of
America, but it had the fault
of wasting time in removing
the combs for reversing after
one side had been emptied
of its contents. A simple form of machine for extracting
honey by centrifugal force was brought to notice in England
in 1875, and was soon improved upon, as will be seen in fig.
19, which shows a section of one of the best English machines
at that time. Various plans were tried in America to improve
on the &ldquo;Novice&rdquo; machine, and Mr T.W. Cowan, who was
experimenting in the same direction in England, invented in
the year 1875 a machine called the &ldquo;Rapid,&rdquo; in which, the combs
were reversed without removal of the cages (fig. 20).
The frame-cases&mdash;wired on both sides&mdash;are
hung at the angles of a revolving
ring of iron, and the reversing
process is so simple and effective
that the &ldquo;Cowan&rdquo; reversible
frame has been adopted in all
the best machines both in Great
Britain and in America.</p>

<p>The latest form of honey
extractor used in America is that
known as the &ldquo;Four-frame
Cowan.&rdquo; Fig. 21 shows the
working part or inside of the
appliance. In this, and indeed
in all extractors used in large
apiaries, the &ldquo;Cowan&rdquo; or reversible
frame principle is used.
Each of the four cages in which
the combs are placed is swung
on a pivot attached to the side,
and when the outer faces of the
combs are emptied the cages are
reversed without removal from
the machine for emptying the
opposite sides of combs. The
further development of the
honey extractor has of late
been limited to an increase in
the size of machine used, in
order to save time and manual
labour, and thus meet the
requirements of the largest honey
producers, who extract honey
by the car load. Some of the
largest machines&mdash;propelled by
motor power&mdash;are capable of
taking eight or more frames at one time. It may also be claimed
for the honey extractor that it does away with the objection
entertained by many persons to the use of honey, by enabling
the apiarist to remove his produce from the honey-combs in its
purest form untainted by crushed brood and untouched by hand.</p>

<p>Next in importance, to bee-keepers, is the enormous advance
made in late years through the invention of a machine for
manufacturing the impressed wax sheets known as
&ldquo;comb foundation,&rdquo; aptly so named, because upon
<span class="sidenote">Comb foundation.</span>
it the bees build the cells wherein they store their food.
We need not dwell upon the evolution from the crude
idea, which first took form in the endeavour to compel bees to build
straight combs in a given direction by offering them a guiding
line of wax along the under side of each top-bar of the frame in
which the combs were built; but we may glance at the more
important improvements
which gradually developed
as time went on. In 1843
a German bee-keeper,
Krechner by name, conceived
the idea of first
dipping fine linen into
molten wax, then pressing
the sheets so made between
rollers, and thus
forming a waxen midrib
on which the bees would
build their combs. This
experiment was partially
successful, but the instinctive
dislike of bees
to anything of a fibrous
nature caused them completely
to spoil their work
of comb-building in the endeavour to tear or gnaw away
the linen threads whenever they got in touch with them.
In 1857 Mehring (also a German) made a further advance
by the use of wooden moulds for casting sheets of wax impressed
with the hexagonal form of the bee-cell. These
sheets were readily accepted by the bees, and afterwards
plates cast from metal were employed, with so good a result as to
give to the bees as perfect a midrib as that of natural comb with
the deep cell walls cut away. Fig. 22 shows a portion of one of
these metal plates with worker-cells of natural size, <i>i.e.</i> five cells
to the inch. Thus Mehring is justly claimed as the originator
of comb-foundation, though the value of his invention was less
eagerly taken advantage of even in Germany than its merits
deserved. Probably it was ahead of the times, for not until
nearly twenty years later was any prominence given to it, when
Samuel Wagner, founder
and editor of the <i>American Bee
Journal</i>, became impressed
with Mehring&rsquo;s invention and
warmly advocated it in his
paper. Mr Wagner first conceived
the idea of adding
slightly raised side walls to the
hexagonal outlines of the cells,
by means of which the bees are
supplied with the material for
building out one-half or more
of the complete cell walls
or sides. The manifest advantage
of this was at once
realized by practical American
apiarists as saving labour
to the bees and money to the
bee-keeper. One of the first
to recognize its value was Mr
A I. Root, of Medina, Ohio,
who suggested the substitution of embossed rollers in lieu of
flat plates, in order to increase the output of foundation
and lessen its cost to the bee-keeper. He lost no time in
giving practical shape to his views, and mainly through
the inventive genius of a skilled machinist (Mr A. Washburn)
the A. I. Root Co. constructed a roller press (fig 23) for
producing foundation in sheets. This form of machine came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page634" id="page634"></a>634</span>
into extensive use in the United States of America and afterwards
in Great Britain. The first roller press was made
by the A.I. Root Co. and imported by Mr William Raitt, a
Scottish bee-keeper of repute in Perthshire, N.B. In all roller
machines used at that time the plain sheets of wax were first
made by the &ldquo;dipping&rdquo; process, <i>i.e.</i> by repeated dippings of
damped boards in molten wax (kept in liquid condition in tanks immersed in
hot water) until the sheet was of suitable thickness for the purpose. The
prepared sheets were then passed through the rollers, and after being cut
out and trimmed were ready for use.</p>

<tr><td class="caption80">(From Cheshire&rsquo;s <i>Bees and Bee-keeping Scientific and Practical</i>.)</td></tr></table>

<p>Owing to the enormous demand for comb-foundation at
that time various devices were tried with the view of securing (1)
more rapid production, and (2) a foundation thin enough to be
used in surplus chambers when working for comb-honey intended
for table use. Foremost among the able men who experimented
in this latter direction was Mr F.B. Weed, a skilful American
machinist, who, after some years of strenuous effort, succeeded
in devising and perfecting special rollers and dies, by the use of
which foundation was produced with a midrib so thin as to
compare favourably with natural comb built by the bees.
&ldquo;Dipping,&rdquo; however, proved not only a stumbling-block to
speed but to the production of continuous sheets of wax; and
in the end Mr Weed, acting in concert with Mr A.I. Root (who
placed the resources of his enormous factory at his disposal),
devised and perfected machinery&mdash;driven by motor power&mdash;for
manufacturing foundation by what is known as the &ldquo;Weed&rdquo;
process. By this process &ldquo;dipping&rdquo; is abolished, and in its
latest form sheets of wax of any length are produced, passed
between engraved rollers 6 in in diameter, cut to given lengths,
trimmed, counted and paper-tissued ready for packing, at a
rate of speed previously undreamt of.</p>

<p><i>Practical Management of Bees.</i>&mdash;Among the world of insects
the honey-bee stands pre-eminent as the most serviceable to
mankind; from the day on which the little labourer leaves its
home for the first time in search of food, its mission is undoubtedly
useful. Launched upon an unknown world, and
guided by unerring instinct to the very flowers it seeks, the bee
fertilizes fruit and flowers while winging its happy flight among
the blossoms, gathering pollen for the nurslings of its own home
and honey for the use of man. Nothing seems to be lost, nor can
any part of the bee&rsquo;s work be accounted labour in vain; the
very wax from which the insect builds the store-combs for its
food and the cells in which its young are hatched and reared is
valuable to mankind in many ways, and is regarded today no
less than in the past ages as an important commercial product.
The hive bee is, moreover, the only insect known to be capable
of domestication, so far as labouring under the direct control of
the bee-master is concerned, its habits being admirably adapted
for embodying human methods of working for profit in our
present-day life.</p>

<p>In dealing with the practical side of apiculture it will not be
necessary to do more than mention the salient points to be
considered by those desirous of acquiring more complete knowledge
of the subject. Authoritative text-books specially written
for the guidance of bee-keepers are numerous and cheap, and on
no account should any one engage in an attempt to manage bees
on modern lines without a careful perusal of one or more of these.
Bearing this in mind the reader will understand that so much of
the natural history of the honey-bee as is necessary for elucidating
the practical part of our subject may be comprised in
(1) the life of the insect, (2) its mission in life, and (3) utilizing
to the utmost the brief period during which it can labour before being

<p>A prosperous bee-colony managed on modern lines will in the
height of summer consist of three kinds of bees: a queen or
mother-bee, a certain number of drones, and from
80,000 to 100,000 workers. With regard to sex, the
<span class="sidenote">Sex of bees.</span>
queen is a fully-developed female, the drones are males
and the workers may be termed neuters or partially developed
females. These last possess ovaries like the queen, but shrunken
and aborted so as to render the insect normally incapable of
egg-production. The relative importance of the three kinds of bees,
differs greatly in a degree and in somewhat curious fashion.
For instance, the queen (or &ldquo;king&rdquo; of the hives as it was termed
by our forefathers) is of paramount importance at certain
<span class="sidenote">Loss of queens.</span>
seasons, her death or disablement during the period
when the male element is absent meaning extinction
of the whole colony. Fecundation would under such conditions
be impossible, and without this the eggs of a resultant
queen will produce nothing but drones. During the summer
season, however (from May to July), when drones are abundant,
the loss of a queen is of comparatively little moment, as the
workers can transform eggs (or young larvae not more than three
days old), which would in the ordinary course produce worker
bees, into fully-developed queens, capable of fulfilling all the
maternal duties of a mother-bee. The value of this wonderful
provision of nature to the bee-keeper of today may be estimated
from the fact that bees managed according to modern methods are
necessarily subject to so much manipulating or handling, that
fatal accidents are as likely to happen in bee life as among
human beings.</p>

<p>Authorities differ with regard to the age during which the
queen bee is useful to the bee-keeper who works for profit.
Under normal conditions the insect will live for three, four or
sometimes five years, but the stimulation given together with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page635" id="page635"></a>635</span>
the high-pressure system followed in modern bee-management,
exhausts the period of her greatest fecundity in two years, so
that queens are usually superseded after their second season
has expired and egg-production gradually decreases. This can
hardly cause wonder if it is borne in mind that for many weeks
during the height of the season a prolific queen will deposit eggs
at the rate of from two to three thousand every twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>Drones (or male bees) are more or less numerous in hives
according to the skill of the bee-keeper in limiting their production.
It is admitted by those best able to judge
that the proportion of about a hundred drones in each
<span class="sidenote">The drone.</span>
hive is conducive to the prosperity of the colony, but
beyond that number they are worse than useless, being non-producers
and heavy consumers. Thus in times of scarcity,
which are not infrequent during the early part of the season,
they become a heavy tax upon the food-supply of the colony
at the critical period when brood-rearing is accelerated by an
abundance of stores, while shortness of food means a falling-off
in egg-production. The modern bee-keeper, therefore,
allows just so much drone comb in the hive as will produce
a sufficient number of drones to ensure queen-mating, while
affording to the bees the satisfaction of dwelling in a home
equipped according to natural conditions, and containing all
the elements necessary to bee-life. The action of the bees
themselves makes this point clear, for when the season of mating
is past the drone is no longer needed, the providing of winter
stores taking first place in the economy of the hive. So long
as honey is being gathered in plenty drones are tolerated, but
no sooner does the honey harvest show signs of being over than
they are mercilessly killed and cast out of the hive by the workers,
after a brief idle life of about four months&rsquo; duration. Thus
the &ldquo;lazy yawning drone,&rdquo; as Shakespeare puts it, has a short
shrift when his usefulness to the community is ended.</p>

<p>Finally we have the aptly named worker-bee, on whom devolves
the entire labour of the colony. The worker-bee is incapable
of egg-production and can therefore take no part in
the perpetuation of its species, so that individually its
<span class="sidenote">The worker-bee.</span>
value to the community is infinitesimal. Yet it forms
an item in a commonwealth, the members of which are
in all respects equally well endowed. They are in turn skilled
scientists, architects, builders, artisans, labourers and even
scavengers; but collectively they are the rulers on whom the
colony depends for the wonderful condition of law and order
which has made the bee-community a model of good government
for all mankind. Then so far as regards longevity, the period
<span class="sidenote">Longevity in bees.</span>
of a worker-bee&rsquo;s existence is not measured by numbering
its days but simply by wear and tear, the marvellous
intricacy and wonderful perfection of its framework
being so delicate in construction that after six or seven weeks of
strenuous toil, such as the bee undergoes in summer time, the
little creature&rsquo;s labour is ended by a natural death. On the other
hand, worker-bees hatched in the autumn will seven months
later be strong with the vigour of lusty youth, able to take
their full share in the labour of the hive for six weeks or more
in the early spring, which is the most critical period in the colony&rsquo;s
existence; hence the value to the apiarist of bees hatched
in the autumn.</p>

<p>The mission of the worker-bee is <i>work</i>; not so much for itself
as for the younger members of the community to which it belongs.
We cannot claim for it the virtue of strict honesty with regard
to the stranger, but for its own &ldquo;kith and kin&rdquo; it is a model of
socialism in an ideal form, possessing nothing of its own yet
toiling unceasingly for the good of all. The increasing warmth
of each recurring spring finds the bee awake, and full of eagerness
to be up and doing; its sole mission being apparently to accomplish
as much work as possible while life lasts. The earliest
pollen is sought out from far and near, and has its immediate effect
upon the mother bee of the colony. If healthy and young she
begins egg-laying at once, and brood-rearing proceeds at an
ever-increasing rate as each week passes, until the hive is
brimming over with bees in time for the first honey flow. Then
comes the almost human foresight with which the bee prevents
the inevitable chaos created by an overcrowded home. There
is no cell-room either for storing the abundant supply of food
constantly being brought in, or for the thousands of eggs which
a prolific queen will produce daily as a consequence of general
prosperity; therefore unless help comes from without an exodus
is prepared for, and what is known as &ldquo;swarming&rdquo; takes
place.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine anything more exhilarating
to a beginner in bee-keeping than the sight of his first hive in
the act of swarming. The little creatures are seen
rushing in frantic haste from the hive like a living
<span class="sidenote">Swarming.</span>
stream, filling the air with ever-increasing thousands of
bees on the wing. The incoming workers returning pollen-laden
from the fields, carried away by the prevailing excitement, do
not stop to unload their burdens in the old home, but join the
enthusiastic emigrants, tumbling over each other pell-mell
in the outrush; among them the queen of the colony will in due
course have taken her place, bound like her children for a new
home. It soon becomes apparent to the onlooker when the
queen has joined the flying multitude of bees in the air, for they
are seen to be closing up their ranks, and in a few moments
begin to form a solid cluster, usually on the branch of a small
tree or bush close to the ground. When this stage of swarming
is reached the bee-keeper has but to take his hiving skep, hold it
under the swarm, and shake the bees into it, preparatory to transferring
<span class="sidenote">Hiving swarms.</span>
them into a frame-hive already prepared for their reception.
The process of hiving a swarm is very simple and need not occupy many
moments of time under ordinary conditions, but so many unlooked-for
contingencies may arise that the apiarist would do well to prepare
himself beforehand by carefully reading the directions in his
text-book.</p>

<p>The illustration given in fig. 25 will serve more readily than
words to enlighten the would-be bee-keeper. It shows a portion
of honeycomb (natural size) not precisely as it appears when
the frame containing it is lifted out of the hive, but as would be
seen on two or more combs in the same hive, namely, the various
cells built for&mdash;and occupied by&mdash;queens, drones and workers;
also the larvae or grubs in the various stages of transformation
from egg to perfect insect, with the latter biting their way out
of sealed cells. It also shows sealed honey and pollen in cells,
&amp;c. To familiarize himself with the various objects depicted,
all of which are drawn from nature, will not only help the reader
to understand the different phases of bee-life during the swarming
season, but tend to increase the interest of beginners in
the pursuit. &ldquo;Early drones, early swarms&rdquo; was the ancient
bee-man&rsquo;s favourite adage, and the skilled apiarist of to-day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page636" id="page636"></a>636</span>
experiences the same pleasurable thrill as did the skeppist of
old at the sight of the first drone of the year, which betokens
an early swarm. As the drones increase in number queen-cells
are formed, unless steps be taken to turn aside the swarming
impulse by affording additional room beforehand in the hive.
The above brief outline of the guiding principles of natural
swarming is merely intended as introductory to the fuller
information given in a good text-book.</p>

<p><i>Management of an Apiary.</i>&mdash;The main consideration in establishing
an apiary is to secure a favourable location, which means
a place where honey of good marketable quality may be gathered
from the bee-forage growing around without any planting on
the part of the bee-keeper himself. It is impossible to deal
here with the varying conditions under which apiculture is
carried on in all parts of the world, but, as a rule, the same
principle applies everywhere. The bee industry prospers greatly
<span class="sidenote"> Bee-forage in U.S.A.</span>
in America, where amid the vast stretches of mountain
and canyon in California the bee-forage extends for
miles without a break, and the climatic conditions
are so generally favourable as to reduce to a minimum
the chances of the honey crop failing through adverse weather.</p>

<p>The bee-keeper&rsquo;s object is to utilize to the utmost the brief
space of a worker-bee&rsquo;s life in summer, by adopting the best
methods in vogue for building up stocks to full strength before
the honey-gathering time begins, and preparing for it by the
exercise of skill and intelligence in carrying out this work.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom there is a difference of several weeks
in the honey season between north and south. Swarming
usually begins in May in the south of England, and in mid-July
in the north of Scotland, the issue of swarms coinciding with the
early part of the main honey flow. The weather is naturally
more precarious in autumn than earlier in the year, and chances
of success proportionately smaller for northern bee-men, but
the disadvantage to the latter is more than compensated for
by the heather season, which extends well into September.
With regard to the British bee-keeper located in the south,
<span class="sidenote">Value of pollen.</span>
the early fruit crop is what concerns him most, and
where pollen (the fertilizing dust of flowers) is plentiful
his bees will make steady progress. If pollen is scarce,
a substitute in the form of either pea-meal or wheaten flour
must be supplied to the bees, as brood-rearing cannot make
headway without the nitrogenous element indispensable in the
food on which the young are reared. But the main honey-crop
of both north and south is gathered from the various trifoliums,
<span class="sidenote">The queen of bee-plants.</span>
among which the white Dutch or common clover
(<i>Trifolium repens</i>) is acknowledged to be the most
important honey-producing plant wherever it grows.
In the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand
and in many other parts of the world honey of the finest quality
is obtained from this &ldquo;queen of bee-plants,&rdquo; and in lesser degree
from other clovers such as sainfoin, alsike (a hybrid clover),
trefoil, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Before undertaking the management of a modern apiary, the
bee-keeper should possess a certain amount of aptitude for
the pursuit, without which it is hardly possible to succeed. He
must also acquire the ability to handle bees judiciously and
well under all imaginable conditions. In doing this it is needful
to remember that bees resent outside interference with either
their work or their hives, and will resolutely defend themselves
when aroused even at the cost of life itself. Experience has also
proved that, when alarmed, bees instinctively begin to fill their
honey-sacs with food from the nearest store-cells as a safeguard
against contingencies, and when so provided they are more
amenable to interference. The bee-keeper, therefore, by the
judicious application of a little smoke from smouldering fuel,
blown into the hive by means of an appliance known as a bee-smoker,
alarms the bees and is thus able to manipulate the frames
of comb with ease and almost no disturbance. The smoker
(fig. 26) devised by T.F. Bingham of Farwell, Michigan, U.S.A.,
is the one most used in America and in the United Kingdom.
No other protection is needed beyond a bee-veil of fine black
net, which slipped over a wide-brimmed straw hat protects the
face from stings when working among bees; as experience is
gained the veil is not always used. The man who is hasty and
nervous in temperament, who fears an occasional sting, and
resents the same by viciously killing the bee that inflicts it
will rarely make a good apiarist.  The methods of handling bees
vary in different countries, this being in a great measure
accounted for by the number of hives kept. Very few apiaries
in the United Kingdom contain more than a hundred hives;
consequently the British bee-keeper has no need for employing
the forceful or &ldquo;hustling&rdquo; methods found necessary in America,
<span class="sidenote">British and American methods.</span>
where the honey-crop is gathered in car-loads and the
hives numbered by thousands. It naturally follows
that bee-life is there regarded very slightly by comparison,
and the bee-garden in England becomes
the &ldquo;bee-yard&rdquo; in America, where the apiarist when at work
must thoroughly protect himself from being stung, and, safe
in his immunity from damage, cares little for bee-life in getting
through his task, the loss of a few
hundred bees being considered of
no account. There are, however,
other reasons, apart from humanity,
to account for the difference in
handling bees as advocated in
the United Kingdom. The great
majority of apiaries owned by
British bee-keepers are located in
close proximity to neighbours;
consequently a serious upset among
the bees would in many cases involve
an amount of trouble which
should if possible be avoided;
therefore quietness and the exercise
of care when manipulating are
always recommended by teachers,
and practised by those who wisely
take their lessons to heart.</p>

<p>Having made himself proficient
in practical bee-work and chosen a suitable location for
his apiary, the bee-keeper should carefully select the particular
type of hive most suited to his means and
requirements. This point settled, uniformity is
<span class="sidenote">Chosing a location.</span>
secured, and all loose parts of the hives being
interchangeable time will be saved during the busy season
when time means money. Beginning with not too many
stocks he can test the capabilities of his location before
investing much capital in the undertaking, so that by utilizing
the information already given and adopting the wise adage
&ldquo;make haste slowly&rdquo; he will realize in good time whether it
will pay best to work for honey in comb or extracted honey
in bulk; not only so, but the knowledge gained will enable
him to select such appliances as are suited to his needs. As a rule,
<span class="sidenote">Bee-keeping for profit.</span>
it may be said that the man content to start with an
apiary of moderate size&mdash;say fifty stocks&mdash;may
realize a fair profit from comb-honey only; but so
limited a venture would need to be supplemented
by some other means before an adequate income could be secured.
On the other hand, the owner of one or two hundred colonies
would find it more lucrative to work for extracted honey and send
it out to wholesale buyers in that form. By so doing a far
greater weight of surplus per hive may be secured, and extracted
honey will keep in good condition for years, while comb-honey
must be sold before granulation sets in. At the same time it
is but fair to say that bee-culture in the United Kingdom, if
limited to honey-production alone, is not sufficiently safe for
entire reliance to be placed on it for obtaining a livelihood.
The uncertain climate renders it necessary to include either
other branches of the craft less dependent on warmth and
sunshine, or to combine it with fruit-growing, poultry-rearing,
&amp;c. Under such conditions the bees will usually occupy a good
position in the balance-sheet.</p>

<p>Another indispensable feature of good bee-management is
&ldquo;forethought,&rdquo; coupled with order and neatness; the rule of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page637" id="page637"></a>637</span>
&ldquo;a place for everything and everything in its place&rdquo; prepares
the bee-keeper for any emergency; constant watchfulness is
<span class="sidenote">Need of forethought.</span>
also necessary, not only to guard against disease in
his hives, but to overlook nothing that tends to be of
advantage to the bees at all seasons. Among the many
ways of saving time nothing is more useful than a
carefully-kept note-book, wherein are recorded brief memoranda
regarding such items as condition of each stock when packed
for winter, amount of stores, age and prolific capacity of queen,
strength of colony, healthiness or otherwise, &amp;c., all of which
particulars should be noted and the hives to which they refer
plainly numbered. It also enables the bee-keeper to arrange his
day&rsquo;s work indoors while avoiding disturbance to such colonies
as do not need interference. In the early spring stores must be
seen to and replenished where required; breeding stimulated
when pollen begins to be gathered, and appliances cleaned and
prepared for use during the busy season.</p>

<p>The main honey-gathering time (lasting about six or seven
weeks) is so brief that in no pursuit is it more important to
&ldquo;make hay while the sun shines,&rdquo; and if the bee-keeper
needs a reminder of this truism he surely has it in the
<span class="sidenote">Length of bee season.</span>
example set by his bees. As the season advances and
the flowers yield nectar more freely, visible signs of comb-building
will be observed in the whitened edges of empty
cells in the brood-chambers; the thoughtful workers are
lengthening out the cells for honey-storing, and the bee-master
takes the hint by giving room in advance, thus lessening the
chance of undesired swarms. In other words, order and method,
combined with the habit of taking time by the forelock, are
absolutely necessary to the bee-keeper, seeing that the enormous
army of workers under his control is multiplying daily by
scores of thousands. As spring merges into summer, sunny days
become more frequent; the ever-increasing breadth of bee-forage
yields still more abundantly, and the excitement among
the labourers crowding the hives increases, rendering room in
advance, shade and ventilation, a <i>sine qua non</i>.
It requires a level head to keep cool amongst a couple of hundred
strong stocks of bees on a hot summer&rsquo;s day in a good honey season.
<span class="sidenote">Swarm prevention.</span>
Moreover, it will be too late to think of giving ventilation
at noontide, when the temperature has risen to
80° F. in the shade; the necessary precautions for
swarm prevention must therefore be taken in advance,
for when what is known as the &ldquo;swarming fever&rdquo; once starts
it is most difficult to overcome.</p>

<p>The well-read and intelligent bee-keeper, content to work on
orthodox lines, will be able to manage an apiary&mdash;large or small&mdash;by
guiding and controlling the countless army he commands in a
way that will yield him both pleasure and profit. All he needs
is good bee weather and an apiary free from disease to make him
appreciate bee-craft as one of the most remunerative of rural
industries; affording a wholesome open-air life conducive to
good health and yielding an abundance of contentment.</p>

<p><i>Diseases of Bees</i>.&mdash;It is quite natural that bees living in
colonies should be subject to diseases, and only since the
introduction of movable-comb hives has it been possible to learn
something about these ailments. The most serious disease with
which the bee-keeper has to contend is that commonly known
as &ldquo;bee-pest&rdquo; or &ldquo;foul brood,&rdquo; so called because of the young
brood dying and rotting in the cells. This disease has been
known from the earliest ages, and is probably the same as that
designated by Pliny as <i>blapsigonia (Natural History</i>, bk. xi.
ch. xx.). Coming to later times, Della Rocca minutely describes
a disease to which bees were subject in the island of Syra, between
the years 1777 and 1780, and through which nearly every colony
in the island perished. From the description given it was
undoubtedly foul brood, and the bee-keepers of the island
became convinced, after bitter experience, that it was extremely
contagious. Schirach also mentioned and described the disease
in 1769, and was the first to give it the name of &ldquo;foul brood.&rdquo;
Still later, in 1874, Dr Cohn, after the most exhaustive experiments
and bacteriological research, realized that the disease was
caused by a bacillus, and&mdash;nine years later&mdash;the name <i>Bacillus
alvei</i> was given to it by Cheyne and Cheshire, whose views were
in agreement with those of Dr Cohn.</p>

<p>The illustration (fig. 27) shows a portion of comb affected with
foul brood in its worst form. The sealed cells are dark-coloured
and sunken, pierced with irregular holes, and the larvae in all
stages from the crescent-shaped healthy condition to that in
which the dead larvae are seen lying at the bottom of the cells,
flaccid and shapeless. The remains then change to buff colour,
afterwards turning brown, when decomposition sets in, and as
the bacilli present in the dead larvae increase and the nutrient
matter is consumed, the mass in some cases becomes sticky and
ropy in character, making its removal impossible by the bees.
In course of time it dries up, leaving nothing but a brown scale
adhering to the bottom or side of the cell. In the worst cases
the larvae even die after the cells are sealed over; a strong
characteristic and offensive odour being developed in some
phases of the disease, noticeable at times some distance away
from the hive.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="clear: both;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption80">(From Cheshire&rsquo;s <i>Bees and Bee-keeping, Scientific and Practical.</i>)</td></tr></table>

<p>Two forms of foul brood have been long known, one foul
smelling, the other odourless; and investigations made during
1906 and 1907 showed that the etiology of the disease is not by
any means simple, but that it is produced by different microbes,
two others in addition to <i>Bacillus alvei</i> playing an important
part. These are <i>Bacillus brandenburgiensis</i>, Maassen (syn.
<i>B. burri</i>, Burri: <i>B. larvae</i>, white), and <i>Streptococcus apis</i>,
Maassen (syn. <i>B. Guntheri</i>, Burri). The first two are found in
both forms of foul brood, whereas the last is only present with
<i>B. alvei</i> in the strong-smelling form of the disease, in which the
larvae are attacked prior to the cells being sealed over.</p>

<p>The brood of bees, when healthy, lies in the combs in compact
masses, the larvae being plump and of a pearly whiteness, and
when quite young curled up on their sides at the base of the
cells. When attacked by the disease, the larva moves uneasily,
stretches itself out lengthwise in the cell, and finally becomes
loose and flabby, an appearance which plainly indicates death.</p>

<p>When the disease attacks the larvae before they are sealed
over <i>Bacillus alvei</i> is present, usually associated with
<i>Streptococcus apis</i>, which latter imparts a sour smell to the dead
brood. In cases where the disease is odourless the larvae are attacked
after the cells are sealed over, and just before they change to
pupae, when they become slimy, sputum-like masses, difficult
to remove from the cells. Under these conditions <i>Bacillus
brandenburgiensis</i> is found, although <i>Bacillus alvei</i> may also
be present. The two bacilli are antagonistic, each striving for
supremacy, first one then the other predominating. Various
other microbes are also present in large numbers, but are not
believed to be pathogenic or disease-producing in character.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, seen that at least three different microbes play
an important part in the same disease. The danger of contagion
lies in the wonderful vitality of the spores, and their great
resistance to heat and cold. Dr Maassen records a case where
he had no difficulty in obtaining cultures from spores removed
from combs after being kept dry for twenty years. It should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page638" id="page638"></a>638</span>
borne in mind that the disease is much easier to cure in the
earlier stages while the bacilli are still rod-shaped than when the
rods have turned to spores.</p>

<p>Since the bacterial origin of foul brood has been established,
the efforts of some bacteriologists have been employed in finding
a simple remedy by means of which the disease may be checked
in its earliest stages, and in this an appreciable amount of success
has been attained. Nor has foul brood in its more advanced
forms been neglected, all directions for treatment being found
in text-books written by distinguished writers on apiculture in
the United Kingdom, America and throughout the European continent.</p>

<p>The only other disease to which reference need be made here
is dysentery, which sometimes breaks out after the long
confinement bees are compelled to undergo during severe winters.
This trouble may be guarded against by feeding the bees in the
early autumn with good food made from cane sugar, and housing
them in well-ventilated hives kept warm and dry by suitable
coverings. When bees are wintered on thin, watery food not
sealed over, and are unable for months to take cleansing flights,
they become weak and involuntarily discharge their excrement
over the combs and hive, a state of things never seen in a healthy
colony under normal conditions. The stocks of bee-keepers
who attend to the instructions given in text-books are rarely
visited by this disease.</p>

<p>The above embraces all that is necessary to be said in relation
to diseases, though bees have been subject to other ailments
such as paralysis, constipation, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the Isle of Wight a serious epidemic broke out in 1906
which caused great destruction to bee-life in the following year.
The malady was of an obscure character, but its cause has been
under investigation by the British Board of Agriculture and
Fisheries, and by European bacteriologists in 1908.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;Though in modern times a great deal has appeared
in the daily newspapers on the subject, it is a notable fact that not a
tithe of the wonderful things published in such articles about bees
and bee-keeping is worthy of credence or possesses any real value.
Indeed, a pressman possessing any technical knowledge of the
subject&mdash;beyond that obtainable from books&mdash;would be a <i>rara avis</i>.
The account given above is the result of forty years&rsquo; practical

<p><span class="bold">BEECH,<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> a well-known tree, <i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, a member of the
order Fagaceae to which belong the sweet-chestnut (<i>Castanea</i>)
and oak. The name beech is from the Anglo-Saxon <i>boc, bece</i> or
<i>beoce</i> (Ger. <i>Buche</i>, Swedish, <i>bok</i>), words meaning at once a book
and a beech-tree. The connexion of the beech with the graphic
arts is supposed to have originated in the fact that the ancient
Runic tablets were formed of thin boards of beech-wood. &ldquo;The
origin of the word,&rdquo; says Prior (<i>Popular Names of British Plants</i>),
&ldquo;is identical with that of the Sanskrit <i>b&#333;k&#333;</i>, letter, <i>b&#333;k&#333;s</i>, writings;
and this correspondence of the Indian and our own is interesting
as evidence of two things, viz. that the Brahmins had the art of
writing before they detached themselves from the common stock
of the Indo-European race in Upper Asia, and that we and other
Germans have received alphabetic signs from the East by a
northern route and not by the Mediterranean.&rdquo; Beech-mast,
the fruit of the beech-tree, was formerly known in England as
buck; and the county of Buckingham is so named from its fame
as a beech-growing country. Buckwheat (<i>Bucheweizen</i>) derives
its name from the similarity of its angular seeds to beech-mast.
The generic name Fagus is derived from <span class="grk" title="phagein">&#966;&#940;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span> to eat; but the
<span class="grk" title="phaegos">&#966;&#951;&#947;&#972;&#962;</span> of Theophrastus was probably the sweet chestnut
(<i>Aesculus</i>) of the Romans. Beech-mast has been used as food in times of
distress and famine; and in autumn it yields an abundant supply
of food to park-deer and other game, and to pigs, which are
turned into beech-woods in order to utilize the fallen mast. In
France it is used for feeding pheasants and domestic poultry.
Well-ripened beech-mast yields from 17 to 20% of non-drying
oil, suitable for illumination, and said to be used in some parts
of France and other European countries in cooking, and as a
substitute for butter.</p>

<p>The beech is one of the largest British trees, particularly on
chalky or sandy soils, native in England from Yorkshire southwards,
and planted in Scotland and Ireland. It is one of the
common forest trees of temperate Europe, spreading from
southern Norway and Sweden to the Mediterranean. It is
found on the Swiss Alps to about 5000 ft. above sea-level, and
in southern Europe is usually confined to high mountain slopes;
it is plentiful in southern Russia, and is widely distributed in
Asia Minor and the northern provinces of Persia.</p>

<p>It is characterized by its sturdy pillar-like stem, often from
15 to 20 ft. in girth, and smooth olive-grey bark. The main
branches rise vertically, while the subsidiary branches spread
outwards and give the whole tree a rounded outline. The
slender brown pointed buds give place in April to clear green
leaves fringed with delicate silky hairs. The flowers which
appear in May are inconspicuous and, as usual with our forest
trees, of two kinds; the male, in long-stalked globular clusters,
hang from the axils of the lower leaves of a shoot, while the
female, each of two or three flowers in a tiny cup (cupule of bracts),
stand erect nearer the top of the shoot. In the ripe fruit or
mast the four-sided cupule, which has become much enlarged,
brown and tough, encloses two or three three-sided rich chestnut-brown
fruits, each containing a single seed. It is readily propagated
by its seeds. It is a handsome tree in every stage of its
growth, but is more injurious to plants under its drip than other
trees, so that shade-bearing trees, as holly, yew and thuja,
suffer. Its leaves, however, enrich the soil. The beech has a
remarkable power of holding the ground where the soil is congenial,
and the deep shade prevents the growth of other trees.
It is often and most usefully mixed with oak and Scotch fir.
The timber is not remarkable for either strength or durability.
It was formerly much used in mill-work and turnery; but its
principal use at present is in the manufacture of chairs, bedsteads
and a variety of minor articles. It makes excellent fuel and
charcoal. The copper-beech is a variety with copper-coloured
leaves, due to the presence of a red colouring-matter in the sap.
There is also a weeping or pendulous-branched variety; and several
varieties with more or less cut leaves, are known in cultivation.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Fagus</i> is widely spread in temperate regions, and
contains in addition to our native beech, about 15 other species.
A variety (<i>F. sylvatica</i> var. <i>Sieboldi</i>) is a native of Japan,
where it is one of the finest and most abundant of the deciduous-leaved
forest trees. <i>Fagus americana</i> is one of the most beautiful and
widely-distributed trees of the forests of eastern North America.
It was confounded by early European travellers with <i>F. sylvatica</i>,
from which it is distinguished by its paler bark and lighter green,
more sharply-toothed leaves. Several species are found in
Australia and New Zealand, and in the forests of southern Chile
and Patagonia. The dense forests which cover the shore of the
Straits of Magellan and the mountain-slopes of Tierra del Fuego
consist largely of two beeches&mdash;one evergreen, <i>Fagus betuloides</i>,
and one with deciduous leaves, <i>F. antarctica</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEECHER, HENRY WARD<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span> (1813-1887), American preacher
and reformer, was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, on the 24th
of June 1813. He was the eighth child of Lyman and Roxana
Foote Beecher, and brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe. Entering
Amherst College in 1830, and graduating four years later, he
gave more attention to his own courses of reading than to
college studies, and was more popular with his fellows than
with the faculty. With a patience foreign to his impulsive
nature, he submitted to minute drill in elocution, and became
a fluent extemporaneous speaker. Reared in a Puritan atmosphere,
he has graphically described the mystical experience
which, coming to him in his early youth, changed his whole
conception of theology and determined his choice of the ministry.
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that when I stand in Zion and before God,
the highest thing that I shall look back upon will be that blessed
morning of May when it pleased God to reveal to my wondering
soul the idea that it was His nature to love a man in his sins for
the sake of helping him out of them.&rdquo; In 1837 he graduated from
Lane Theological Seminary in Ohio, of which his father was
president, and entered upon his work as pastor of a missionary
Presbyterian church at Lawrenceburg, Indiana, a village on the
Ohio, about 20 m. below Cincinnati. The membership numbered
nineteen women and one man. Beecher was sexton as well as
preacher. Two years later he accepted a call to Indianapolis.
His unconventional preaching shocked the more staid members
of the flock, but filled the church to overflowing with people
unaccustomed to churchgoing. He studied men rather than
books; became acquainted with the vices in what was then a
pioneer town; and in his <i>Seven Lectures to Young Men</i> (1844)
treated these with genuine power of realistic description and
with youthful and exuberant rhetoric. Eight years later (1847)
he accepted a call to the pastorate of Plymouth Church (Congregational),
then newly organized in Brooklyn, New York.
The situation of the church, within five minutes&rsquo; walk of the chief
ferry to New York, the stalwart character of the man who had
organized it, and the peculiar eloquence of Beecher, combined
to make the pulpit a national platform. The audience-room
of the church, capable of seating 2000 or 2500 people, frequently
contained 500 or 1000 more.</p>

<p>Beecher at once became a recognized leader. On the all-absorbing
question of slavery he took a middle ground between the
pro-slavery or peace party, and abolitionists like William Lloyd
Garrison and Wendell Phillips, believing, with such statesmen
as W.H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, and Abraham Lincoln,
that slavery was to be overthrown under the constitution and
in the Union, by forbidding its growth and trusting to an
awakened conscience, enforced by an enlightened self-interest.
He was always an anti-slavery man, but never technically an
abolitionist, and he joined the Republican party soon after its
organization. In the earlier days of the agitation, he challenged
the hostility which often mobbed the anti-slavery gatherings;
in the later days he consulted with the political leaders, inspiring
the patriotism of the North, and sedulously setting himself to
create a public opinion which should confirm and ratify the
emancipation proclamation whenever the president should
issue it. When danger of foreign intervention cast its threatening
shadow across the national path, he went to England, and by
his famous addresses did what probably no other American
could have done to strengthen the spirit in England favourable
to the United States, and to convert that which was doubtful
and hostile. In 1861-1863 he was the editor-in-chief of the
<i>Independent</i>, then a Congregational journal; and in his editorials,
copied far and wide, produced a profound impression on the public mind
by clarifying and defining the issue. Later (in 1870),
he founded and became editor-in-chief of the <i>Christian Union</i>,
afterwards the <i>Outlook</i>, a religious undenominational weekly.
His lectures and addresses had the spirit if not the form of his
sermons, just as his sermons were singularly free from the
homiletical tone. Yet his work as a reformer was subsidiary
to his work as a preacher. He was not indeed a parish pastor;
he inspired church activities which grew to large proportions,
but trusted the organization of them to laymen of organizing
abilities in the church; and for acquaintance with his people
he depended on such social occasions as were furnished in the
free atmosphere of this essentially New England church at the
close of every service. But during his pastorate the church grew
to be probably the largest in membership in the United States.</p>

<p>It was in the pulpit that Beecher was seen at his best. His
mastery of the English tongue, his dramatic power, his instinctive
art of impersonation, which had become a second nature, his
vivid imagination, his breadth of intellectual view, the catholicity
of his sympathies, his passionate enthusiasm, which made for
the moment his immediate theme seem to him the one theme of
transcendent importance, his quaint humour alternating with
genuine pathos, and above all his simple and singularly
unaffected devotional nature, made him as a preacher without a
peer in his own time and country. His favourite theme was
love: love to man was to him the fulfilment of all law; love of
God was the essence of all Christianity. Retaining to the day
of his death the forms and phrases of the New England theology
in which he had been reared, he poured into them a new meaning
and gave to them a new significance. He probably did more
than any other man in America to lead the Puritan churches
from a faith which regarded God as a moral governor, the Bible
as a book of laws, and religion as obedience to a conscience to
a faith which regards God as a father, the Bible as a book of
counsels, and religion as a life of liberty in love. The later years
of his life were darkened by a scandal which Beecher&rsquo;s personal,
political and theological enemies used for a time effectively to
shadow a reputation previously above reproach, he being
charged by Theodore Tilton, whom he had befriended, with
having had improper relations with his (Tilton&rsquo;s) wife. But in
the midst of these accusations (February 1876), the largest and
most representative Congregational council ever held in the
United States gave expression to a vote of confidence in him,
which time has absolutely justified. Not a student of books nor
a technical scholar in any department, Beecher&rsquo;s knowledge
was as wide as his interests were varied. He was early familiar
with the works of Matthew Arnold, Charles Darwin and Herbert
Spencer; he preached his <i>Bible Studies</i> sermons in 1878, when
the higher criticism was wholly unknown to most evangelical
ministers or known only to be dreaded; and his sermons on
<i>Evolution and Religion</i> in 1885, when many of the ministry
were denouncing evolution as atheistic. He was stricken with
apoplexy while still active in the ministry, and died at Brooklyn
on the 8th of March 1887, in the seventy-fourth year of his age.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEECHER, LYMAN<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> (1775-1863), American clergyman, was born at New Haven,
Connecticut, on the 12th of October 1775. He was a descendant of one of
the founders of the New Haven colony, worked as a boy in an uncle&rsquo;s
blacksmith shop and on his farm, and in 1797 graduated from Yale, having
studied theology under Timothy Dwight. He preached in the Presbyterian
church at East Hampton, Long Island (1798-1810, being ordained in 1799);
in the Congregational church at Litchfield, Connecticut (1810-1826), in
the Hanover Street church of Boston (1826-1832), and in the Second
Presbyterian church of Cincinnati, Ohio (1833-1843); was president of
the newly established Lane Theological Seminary at Walnut Hills,
Cincinnati, and was professor of didactic and polemic theology there
(1832-1850), being professor emeritus until his death. At Litchfield and
in Boston he was a prominent opponent of the growing &ldquo;heresy&rdquo; of
Unitarianism, though as early as 1836 he was accused of being a
&ldquo;moderate Calvinist&rdquo; and was tried for heresy, but was acquitted. Upon
his resignation from Lane Theological Seminary he lived in Boston for a
short time, devoting himself to literature; but he broke down, and the
last ten years of his life were spent at the home of his son, Henry Ward
Beecher, in Brooklyn, New York, where he died on the both of January
1863. Magnetic in personality, incisive and powerful in manner of
expression, he was in his prime one of the most eloquent of American
pulpit orators. In 1806 he preached a widely circulated sermon on
duelling, and about 1814 a series of six sermons on intemperance, which
were reprinted frequently and greatly aided temperance reform. Thrice
married, he had a large family, his seven sons becoming Congregational
clergymen, and his daughters, Harriet Beecher Stowe (<i>q.v.</i>) and Catherine
Esther Beecher, attaining literary distinction.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Lyman Beecher&rsquo;s published works include: <i>A Plea for the West</i> (1835),

Litchfield Seminary, and from 1822 to 1832 conducted a school for girls
at Hartford, Connecticut, with her sister Harriet&rsquo;s assistance, and from
1832 to 1834 conducted a similar school in Cincinnati. She wrote and
lectured on women&rsquo;s education and in behalf of better primary schools,
and radically opposed woman suffrage and college education for women,
holding woman&rsquo;s sphere to be domestic. The National Board of Popular
Education, a charitable society which she founded, sent hundreds of
women as teachers into the South and West. She died on the 12th of May
1878 in Elmira, New York. She published <i>An Essay on Slavery and

geographer, son of Sir William Beechey, R.A., was born in London on the
17th of February 1796. In 1806 he entered the navy, and saw active
service during the wars with France and America. In 1818 he served under
Lieutenant (afterwards Sir) John Franklin in Buchan&rsquo;s Arctic expedition,
of which at a later period he published a narrative; and in the
following year he accompanied Lieutenant W.E. Parry in the &ldquo;Hecla.&rdquo; In
1821 he took part in the survey of the Mediterranean coast of Africa
under the direction of Captain, afterwards Admiral, William Henry Smyth.
He and his brother Henry William Beechey, made an overland survey of
this coast, and published a full account of their work in 1828 under the
title of <i>Proceedings of the Expedition to Explore the Northern Coast of
Africa from Tripoly Eastward in 1821-1822</i>. In 1825 Beechey was
appointed to command the &ldquo;Blossom,&rdquo; which was intended to explore Bering
Strait, in concert with Franklin and Parry operating from the east. He
passed the strait and penetrated as far as 71° 23&prime; 31&Prime; N., and 156° 21&prime;
30&Prime; W., reaching a point only 146 m. west of that reached by Franklin&rsquo;s
expedition from the Mackenzie river. The whole voyage lasted more than
three years; and in the course of it Beechey discovered several islands
in the Pacific, and an excellent harbour near Cape Prince of Wales. In
1831 there appeared his <i>Narrative of a Voyage to the Pacific and
Bering&rsquo;s Strait to Co-operate with the Polar Expeditions, 1825-1828</i>. In
1835 and the following year Captain Beechey was employed on the coast
survey of South America, and from 1837 to 1847 carried on the same work
along the Irish coasts. He was appointed in 1850 to preside over the
Marine Department of the Board of Trade. In 1854 he was made
rear-admiral, and in the following year was elected president of the
Royal Geographical Society. He died on the 29th of November 1856.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEECHEY, SIR WILLIAM<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> (1753-1839), English portrait-painter, was born at
Burford. He was originally meant for a conveyancer, but a strong love
for painting induced him to become a pupil at the Royal Academy in 1772.
Some of his smaller portraits gained him considerable reputation; he
began to be employed by the nobility, and in 1793 became associate of
the Academy. In the same year he was made portrait-painter to Queen
Charlotte. He painted the portraits of the members of the royal family,
and of nearly all the most famous or fashionable persons of the time.
What is considered his finest production is a review of cavalry, a large
composition, in the foreground of which he introduced portraits of
George III., the prince of Wales and the duke of York, surrounded by a
brilliant staff on horseback. It was painted in 1798, and obtained for
the artist the honour of knighthood, and his election as R.A.</p>

172 m. by rail N.E. of Melbourne. Pop. (1901) 7359. The
town is the centre of the Ovens goldfields, and the district
is mainly devoted to mining with both alluvial and reef working,
but much of the land is under cultivation, yielding grain and
fruit. The water supply is derived from Lake Kerferd in the
vicinity, which is a favourite resort of visitors; the scenery near
the town, which lies at an elevation of 1805 ft. among the May
Day Hills, being singularly beautiful. The industries of Beechworth
include tanning, ironfounding and coach-building.</p>

&ldquo;beeves,&rdquo; for the ox itself, but usually in an archaic way. &ldquo;Corned&rdquo;

<p><span class="bold">BEEFSTEAK CLUB,<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> the name of several clubs formed in
London during the 18th and 19th centuries. The first seems to
have been that founded in 1709 with Richard Estcourt, the
actor, as steward. Of this the chief wits and great men of the
nation were members and its badge was a gridiron. Its fame was,
however, entirely eclipsed in 1735 when &ldquo;The Sublime Society of
Steaks&rdquo; was established by John Rich at Covent Garden theatre,
of which he was then manager. It is said that Lord Peterborough
supping one night with Rich in his private room, was so delighted
with the steak the latter grilled him that he suggested a repetition
of the meal the next week. From this started the Club, the
members of which delighted to call themselves &ldquo;The Steaks.&rdquo;
Among them were Hogarth, Garrick, Wilkes, Bubb Doddington
and many other celebrities. The rendezvous was the theatre
till the fire in 1808, when the club moved first to the Bedford
Coffee House, and the next year to the Old Lyceum. In 1785
the prince of Wales joined, and later his brothers the dukes of
Clarence and Sussex became members. On the burning of the
Lyceum, &ldquo;The Steaks&rdquo; met again in the Bedford Coffee House
till 1838, when the New Lyceum was opened, and a large room
there was allotted the club. These meetings were held till the
club ceased to exist in 1867. Thomas Sheridan founded a
Beefsteak Club in Dublin at the Theatre Royal in 1749, and of
this Peg Woffington was president. The modern Beefsteak Club
was founded by J.L. Toole, the actor, in 1876.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEELZEBUB,<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> <span class="sc">Beelzebul, Baalzebub</span>. In 2 Kings i. we
read that Ahaziah ben Ahab, king of Israel, fell sick, and sent
to inquire of Baalzebub, the god of the Philistine city Ekron,
whether he should recover. There is no other mention of this
god in the Old Testament. <i>Baal</i>, &ldquo;lord,&rdquo; is the ordinary title
or word for a deity, especially a local deity, cf. such place names
as Baal Hazor (2 Sam. xiii. 23), Baal Hermon (Judges iii. 3),
which are probably contractions of fuller forms, like Beth Baal
Meon (Josh. xiii. 17), the House or Temple of the Baal of Meon.
According to these analogies we should expect <i>Zebub</i> to be a
place. No place <i>Zebub</i>, however, is known; and it has been
objected that the Baal of some other place would hardly be the
god of Ekron. These objections are hardly conclusive.</p>

<p>Usually <i>Zebub</i> is identified with a Hebrew common noun
<i>zebub</i> = flies,<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> occurring twice in the Old Testament,<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
so that Baalzebub &ldquo;is the Baal to whom flies belong or are holy. As
children of the summer they are symbols of the warmth of the
sun, to which ... Baal stands in close relation. Divination by
means of flies was known at Babylon.&rdquo;<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a> There are other cases of
names compounded of Baal and an element equivalent to a
descriptive epithet, <i>e.g.</i> Baalgad, the Baal of Fortune.<a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
For the &ldquo;Fly-god,&rdquo; sometimes interpreted as the &ldquo;averter of
insects,&rdquo; cf <span class="grk" title="Zeus apomouios, muiagros">&#918;&#949;&#8058;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#972;&#956;&#965;&#953;&#959;&#962;, &#956;&#965;&#943;&#945;&#947;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, and the Hercules
<span class="grk" title="muiagros">&#956;&#965;&#943;&#945;&#947;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>. Clemens Alexander speaks of a Hercules
<span class="grk" title="apomuios">&#7936;&#960;&#972;&#956;&#965;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> as worshipped at Rome. It has been suggested
that Baalzebub was the dung-beetle, <i>Scarabaeus pillularius</i>, worshipped in Egypt.</p>

<p>A name of a deity on an Assyrian inscription of the 12th
century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> has been read as <i>Baal-zabubi</i>, but this reading has
now been abandoned in favour of <i>Baal-sapunu</i> (Baal-Zephon).<a name="fa5a" id="fa5a" href="#ft5a"><span class="sp">5</span></a>
Cheyne considers that Baalzebub is a &ldquo;contemptuous uneuphonic
Jewish modification of the true name Baalzebul.&rdquo;<a name="fa6a" id="fa6a" href="#ft6a"><span class="sp">6</span></a></p>

<p>In the New Testament we meet with Beelzebul,<a name="fa7a" id="fa7a" href="#ft7a"><span class="sp">7</span></a> which some of the
versions, especially the Vulgate and Syriac, followed by the
Authorized Version, have changed to Beelzebub, under the
influence of 2 Kings. In Matt. x. 25, Christ speaks of men
calling the master of the house, <i>i.e.</i> Himself, Beelzebul.<a name="fa8a" id="fa8a" href="#ft8a"><span class="sp">8</span></a> In
Mark iii 22-27,<a name="fa9a" id="fa9a" href="#ft9a"><span class="sp">9</span></a> the scribes explain that Jesus is possessed by
Beelzebul<a name="fa10a" id="fa10a" href="#ft10a"><span class="sp">10</span></a> and is thus enabled to cast out devils. The passage
speaks of Beelzebul as Satan and as the prince of the demons.</p>

<p>The origin of the name Beelzebul is variously explained.
(<i>a</i>) It is &ldquo;a phonetic corruption, perhaps a softening of the
original word&rdquo;; as Bab-el-mandel is a corruption of Bab-el-mandeb.
(<i>b</i>) <i>Zebul</i> is from <i>zebel</i>, a word found in the Targums
in the sense of &ldquo;dung,&rdquo; so that Beelzebul would mean &ldquo;Lord
of Dung,&rdquo; a term of contempt. The further suggestion has been
made that <i>zebul</i> itself in the sense of &ldquo;dung&rdquo; is a term for a
heathen deity, cf. the Old Testament use of &ldquo;abomination&rdquo; &amp;c.
for heathen deities, so that Beelzebul would mean &ldquo;Chief of
false gods,&rdquo; and so arch-fiend. (<i>c</i>) <i>Zebul</i> is found in 1 Kings
viii. 13 in the sense of &ldquo;height,&rdquo; <i>beth-sebul</i>&mdash;lofty house, and
in Rabbinical writings in the sense of &ldquo;house&rdquo; or &ldquo;temple,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;the fourth heaven&rdquo;;<a name="fa11a" id="fa11a" href="#ft11a"><span class="sp">11</span></a> and Beelzebul may equal &ldquo;Lord
of the High House&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lord of Heaven.&rdquo; This view is
perhaps favoured by Matt. x. 25, &ldquo;if they have called the lord of
the house Beelzebul.&rdquo; It appears, however, that Rabbinical
writings use <i>y&#333;m</i> (day-of) <i>zebul</i> for the festival of a
heathen deity; and Jastrow connects this usage with the meaning
&ldquo;house&rdquo; or &ldquo;temple,&rdquo; so that the meaning &ldquo;Lord of the False
Gods&rdquo; might be arrived at in a different way.</p>

<p>The names <i>Zebulun, &rsquo;Izebel</i> (Jezebel), suggest that <i>Zebul</i>
may be an ancient name of a deity; cf. the names <span title="baal ezebel">&#1489;&#1506;&#1500; &#1488;&#1494;&#1489;&#1500;</span>
(B&lsquo;L &rsquo;ZBL), <span title="shemzebel">&#1513;&#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1500;</span> (ShMZBL) in Punic and Phoenician
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page642" id="page642"></a>642</span>
inscriptions.<a name="fa12a" id="fa12a" href="#ft12a"><span class="sp">12</span></a> The substitution of Beelzebub for Beelzebul by
the Syriac, Vulgate and other versions implies the identification
of the New Testament arch-fiend with the god of Ekron;
this substitution, however, may be due to the influence of the
Aramaic <i>B&lsquo;el-debaba</i>, &ldquo;adversary,&rdquo; sometimes held to be the
original of these names.</p>

<p>There is no trace of Beelzebul or Beelzebub outside of the
Biblical passages mentioned, and the literature dependent
on them. If we assume a connexion between the two names, there
is nothing to show how the god became in later times the devil.</p>

<p>In <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Book ii., Beelzebub appears as second only
to Satan himself.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEER,<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> a beverage obtained by a process of alcoholic fermentation
mainly from cereals (chiefly malted barley), hops and
water. The history of beer extends over several thousand years.
According to Dr Bush, a beer made from malt or red barley is
mentioned in Egyptian writings as early as the fourth dynasty.
It was called <img style="width:34px; height:33px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img642.jpg" alt="" /> or <i>heqa</i>. Papyri of the time of
Seti I. (1300 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) allude to a person inebriated from over-indulgence
in beer. In the second book (<i>c.</i> 77) of Herodotus (450 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) we
are told that the Egyptians, being without vines, made wine
from barley (cf. Aesch. <i>Suppl.</i> 954); but as the grape is mentioned
so frequently in Scripture and elsewhere as being most abundant
there, and no record exists of the vine being destroyed, we must
conclude that the historian was only partially acquainted with
the productions of that most fertile country. Pliny (<i>Natural
History</i>, xxii. 82) informs us that the Egyptians made wine from
corn, and gives it the name of <i>sythum</i>, which, in the Greek,
means drink from barley. The Greeks obtained their knowledge
of the art of preparing beer from the Egyptians. The writings
of Archilochus, the Parian poet and satirist who flourished
about 650 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, contain evidence that the Greeks of his day were
acquainted with the process of brewing. There is, in fact, little
doubt that the discovery of beer and its use as an exhilarating
beverage were nearly as early as those of the grape itself, though
both the Greeks and the Romans despised it as a barbarian
drink. Dioscorides mentions two kinds of beer, namely <span class="grk" title="zythos">&#950;&#8166;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span>
and <span class="grk" title="kourmi">&#954;&#959;&#8166;&#961;&#956;&#953;</span>, but he does not describe them sufficiently to enable
us to distinguish them. Sophocles and other Greek writers,
again, styled it <span class="grk" title="bryton">&#946;&#961;&#8166;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span>. In the time of Tacitus (1st century
after Christ), according to him, beer was the usual drink of the
Germans, and there can be little doubt that the method of malting
barley was then known to them. Pliny (<i>Nat. Hist.</i> xxii. 82)
mentions the use of beer in Spain under the name of <i>celia</i> and
<i>ceria</i> and in Gaul under that of <i>cerevisia</i>; and elsewhere
(xiv. 29) he says:&mdash;&ldquo;The natives who inhabit the west of Europe have
a liquid with which they intoxicate themselves, made from corn
and water. The manner of making this liquid is somewhat
different in Gaul, Spain and other countries, and it is called by
different names, but its nature and properties are everywhere
the same. The people in Spain in particular brew this liquid
so well that it will keep good a long time. So exquisite is the
cunning of mankind in gratifying their vicious appetites that they
have thus invented a method to make water itself produce intoxication.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The knowledge of the preparation of a fermented beverage
from cereals in early times was not confined to Europe. Thus,
according to Dr H.H. Mann, the Kaffir races of South Africa have
made for ages&mdash;and still make&mdash;a kind of beer from millet, and
similarly the natives of Nubia, Abyssinia and other parts of
Africa prepare an intoxicating beverage, generally called <i>bousa</i>,
from a variety of cereal grains. The Russian <i>quass</i>, made from
barley and rye, the Chinese <i>samshu</i>, made from rice, and the
Japanese <i>saké</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) are all of ancient origin. Roman historians
mention the fact that the Britons in the south of England at the
time of the Roman invasion brewed a species of ale from barley
and wheat. The Romans much improved the methods of brewing
in vogue among the Britons, and the Saxons&mdash;among whom ale
had long been a common beverage&mdash;in their turn profited much
by the instruction given to the original inhabitants of Great
Britain by the Romans. We are informed by William of Malmesbury
that in the reign of Henry II. the English were greatly
addicted to drinking, and by that time the monasteries were
already famous, both in England and on the continent, for the
excellence of their ales. The waters of Burton-on-Trent began
to be famous in the 13th century. The secret of their being so
especially adapted for brewing was first discovered by some
monks, who held land in the adjacent neighbourhood of Wetmore.
There is a document dated 1295 in which it is stated that Matilda,
daughter of Nicholas de Shoben, had re-leased to the abbot and
convent of Burton-on-Trent certain tenements within and
without the town; for which re-lease they granted her, daily for
life, two white loaves from the monastery, two gallons of conventual
beer, and one penny, besides seven gallons of beer for the
men. The abbots of Burton apparently made their own malt,
for it was a common covenant in leases of mills belonging to the
abbey that the malt of the lords of the manor, both spiritual and
temporal, should be ground free of charge. Robert Plot, in his
<i>Natural History of Staffordshire</i> (1686), refers to the peculiar
properties of the Burton waters, from which, he says, &ldquo;by an art
well known in this country good ale is made, in the management
of which they have a knack of fining it in three days to that
degree that it shall not only be potable, but is clear and palatable
as we could desire any drink of this kind to be.&rdquo; In 1630 Burton
beer began to be known in London, being sold at &ldquo;Ye Peacocke&rdquo;
in Gray&rsquo;s Inn Lane, and according to the <i>Spectator</i> was in great
demand amongst the visitors in Vauxhall. Until tea and coffee
were introduced, beer and ale (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ale</a></span>) were, practically speaking,
the only popular beverages accessible to the general body of
consumers. Since the advent of tea, coffee, cocoa and mineral
waters, the character of British beers has undergone a gradual
modification, the strongly alcoholic, heavily hopped liquids
consumed by the previous generation slowly giving place to the
lighter beverages in vogue at the present time. The old &ldquo;stock
bitter&rdquo; has given way to the &ldquo;light dinner ale,&rdquo; and &ldquo;porter&rdquo;
(so called from the fact that it was the popular drink amongst the
market porters of the 18th century) has been largely replaced by
&ldquo;mild ale.&rdquo; A certain quantity of strong beer&mdash;such as heavy
stouts and &ldquo;stock&rdquo; and &ldquo;Scotch&rdquo; ales&mdash;is still brewed nowadays,
but it is not an increasing one. The demand is almost entirely
for medium beers such as mild ale, light stout, and the better class
of &ldquo;bitter&rdquo; beers, and light beers such as the light &ldquo;family ales,&rdquo;
&ldquo;dinner ales&rdquo; and lager.</p>

<p>The general run of beers contain from 3 to 6% of alcohol and
4 to 7% of solids, the remainder being water and certain flavouring
and preservative matters derived from the malt, hops and
other materials employed in their manufacture. The solid, <i>i.e.</i>
non-volatile, matter contained in solution in beer consists mainly
of maltose or malt sugar, of several varieties of dextrin (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brewing</a></span>), of substances which stand in an intermediate position
between the sugars and the dextrins proper, and of a number of
bodies containing nitrogen, such as the non-coagulable proteids,
peptones, &amp;c. In addition there is an appreciable quantity of
mineral matter, chiefly phosphates and potash. Dietetically
regarded, therefore, beer possesses considerable food value, and,
moreover, the nutritious matter in beer is present in a readily
assimilable form.</p>

<p>It is probable that the average adult member of the British
working classes consumes not less than two pints of beer daily.
A reasonable calculation places the total proteids and
carbohydrates consumed by the average worker at 140 and 400
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page643" id="page643"></a>643</span>
grammes respectively. Taking the proteid content of the average
beer at 0.4% and the carbohydrate content at 4%, a simple
calculation shows that about 3% of the total proteid and 11%
of the total carbohydrate food of the average worker will be
consumed in the shape of beer.</p>

<p>The figures in the above tables are very fairly representative
of different classes of British and Irish beers. It will be noticed
that the <i>Mild Ales</i> are of medium original gravity<a name="fa8b" id="fa8b" href="#ft8b"><span class="sp">8</span></a>
and alcoholic strength, but contain a relatively large proportion of solid
matter. The <i>Light Bitters and Ales</i> are of a low original gravity,
but compared with the Mild Ales the proportion of alcohol to
solids is higher. The <i>Pale and Stock Ales</i>, which represent the
more expensive bottle beers, are analytically of much the same
character as the Light Bitters, except that the figures all round
are much higher. The <i>Stouts</i>, as a rule, are characterized by a
high gravity, and contain relatively more solids (as compared
with alcohol) than do the heavy beers of light colour. With
regard to the proportions of the various matters constituting the
extractives (solids) in English beers, roughly 20-30% consists of
maltose and 20-50% of dextrinous matter. In mild ales the
proportion of maltose to dextrin is high (roughly 1:1), thus
accounting for the full sweet taste of these beers. Pale and stock
ales, on the other hand, which are of a &ldquo;dry&rdquo; character, contain
relatively more dextrin, the general ratio being about 1:1½
or 1:2. The mineral matter (&ldquo;ash&rdquo;) of beers is generally in the
neighbourhood of 0.2 to 0.3%, of which about one-fourth is
phosphoric acid. The proteid (&ldquo;nitrogenous matters&rdquo;) content
of beers varies very widely according to character and strength,
the usual limits being 0.3 to 0.8%, with an average of roughly 0.4%.</p>

<p>It will be seen that, broadly speaking, the original gravity of
German and Austrian beers is lower than that of English
beers, and this also applies to the alcohol. On the other
hand, the foreign beers are relatively very rich in solids, and the

<p>It will be noted that the American <i>beers</i> (<i>i.e.</i> bottom

<p>The chief point of interest in the preceding table is the enormous
increase in the United States. In considering the figures, the
character of the beer produced must be taken into consideration.
Thus, although Germany produces roughly 25% more beer in
liquid measurement than the United Kingdom, the latter actually
uses about 50% more malt than is the case in the German
breweries. According to a Viennese technical journal, the
quantities of malt employed for the production of one hectolitre
(22 gallons) of beer in the respective countries is 0.40 cwt. in the
German empire, 0.72 cwt. in the United States, and 0.81 cwt.
in the United Kingdom. In a sense, therefore, England may
still claim pre-eminence as a beer-producing nation. Large as
the <i>per capita</i> consumption in the United Kingdom may seem,
it is considerably less than is the case in Bavaria, which stands
at the head of the list with over 50 gallons, and in Belgium, which
comes second with 47.7 gallons. In the city of Munich the
consumption is actually over 70 gallons, that is to say, about 1½
pints a day for every man, woman and child. It is curious to
note that in Germany, which is usually regarded as a beer-drinking
country <i>par excellence</i>, the consumption per head of this
article is slightly less than in England, and that inversely the
average German consumes more alcohol in the shape of spirits
than does the inhabitant of the British Islands (consumption of
spirits per head: Germany, 1.76 gallons; United Kingdom, 0.99
gallons). This is accounted for by the fact that the peasantry
of the northern and eastern portions of the German empire
consume spirits almost exclusively. In the British colonies
beer is generally one of the staple drinks, but if we except
Western Australia, where about 25 gallons per head of population
are consumed, the demand is much smaller than in the United
Kingdom. In Australia generally, the <i>per capita</i> consumption
amounts to about 12 gallons, in New Zealand to 10 gallons, and
in Canada to 5 gallons.</p>

industry, of the brewer is 1000 times the specific gravity of the
physicist. This is purely a matter of convention and convenience.
Thus when a brewer speaks of a wort of a &ldquo;gravity&rdquo; of 1045
(ten-forty-five) he means a wort having a specific gravity of 1.045. Each
unit in the brewer&rsquo;s scale of specific gravity is termed a &ldquo;degree of
gravity.&rdquo; The wort referred to above, therefore, possesses forty-five
<i>degrees</i> of gravity. The &ldquo;original gravity,&rdquo; it may here be
mentioned, represents the specific gravity of the wort (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brewing</a></span>)
before fermentation. The solids in the original wort may be
ascertained by dividing the excess of the gravity over 1000 by 3.86.
Thus in the case of Mild Ale No. 1 the excess of the original gravity
over 1000 is 1055.13 &minus; 1000 = 55.13. Dividing this by 3.86 we get
14.28, which indicates that the wort from which the beer was
manufactured contained 14.28% of solids. In the trade the gravity of
a beer (or rather of the wort from which it is derived) is generally
expressed in pounds per barrel. This means the excess in weight
of a barrel of the wort over the weight of a barrel of water. The
weight of a barrel (36 gallons) of water is 360 &#8468;; in the above example
the weight of a barrel of the beer wort is 360 × 1.05513 = 379.8.
The gravity of the wort in &#8468; is therefore 379.8 &minus; 360 = 19.8. The
beer which is made from this wort would also be called a 19.8 &#8468;
beer, the reference in all cases being to the original wort.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEERSHEBA,<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> a place midway between Gaza and Hebron
(28 m. from each), frequently referred to in the Bible as the
southern limit of Palestine (&ldquo;Dan to Beersheba,&rdquo; Judg. xx. i, &amp;c.)
Its foundation is variously ascribed to Abraham and Isaac, and
different etymologies for its name are suggested, in the fundamental
documents of Genesis (xxi. 22, xxvi. 26). It was an
important holy place, where Abraham planted a sacred tree
(Gen. xxi. 23), and where divine manifestations were vouchsafed
to Hagar (Gen. xxi. 17), Isaac (xxvi. 24), Jacob (xlvi. 2) and
Elijah (1 Kings xix. 5). Amos mentions it in connexion with
the shrines of Bethel and Gilgal (Amos v. 5) and denounces oaths
by its <i>numen</i> (viii. 14). The most probable meaning of the name
is &ldquo;seven wells,&rdquo; despite the non-Semitic construction involved
in this interpretation. Seven ancient wells still exist here,
though two are stopped up. Eusebius and Jerome mention the
place in the 4th century as a large village and the seat of a Roman
garrison. Extensive remains of this village exist, though they
are being rapidly quarried away for building; some inscriptions
of great importance have been found here. Later it appears to
have been the site of a bishopric; remains of its churches were
still standing in the 14th century. Some fine mosaics have been
here unearthed and immediately destroyed, in sheer wantonness,
by the natives quarrying building-stone. The Biblical Beersheba
probably exists at Bir es-Seba&lsquo;, 2 m. distant.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEESLY, EDWARD SPENCER<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> (1831-&emsp;&emsp;), English historian
and positivist, son of the Rev. James Beesly, was born at Feckenham,
Worcestershire, on the 23rd of January 1831. He was
educated at Wadham College, Oxford, which may be regarded
as the original centre of the English positivist movement.
Richard Congreve (<i>q.v.</i>) was tutor at Wadham from 1849 to 1854,
and three men of that time, Frederic Harrison (<i>q.v.</i>), Beesly and
John Henry Bridges (1832-1906), became the leaders of Comtism
in England. Beesly left Oxford in 1854 to become assistant-master
at Marlborough College. In 1859 he was appointed
professor of history at University College, London, and of Latin
at Bedford College, London, in 1860. He resigned these appointments
in 1893 and 1889, and in 1893 became the editor of the
newly-established <i>Positivist Review</i>. He collaborated in the
translation of Comte&rsquo;s system of <i>Positive Polity</i> (4 vols., 1875-1879),
translated his <i>Discourse on the Positive Spirit</i> (1903),
and wrote a biography of Comte for a translation of the first two
chapters of his <i>Cours de philosophie positive</i>, entitled <i>Fundamental
Principles of Positive Philosophy</i> (1905). Professor Beesly stood
unsuccessfully as Liberal candidate for Westminster in 1885
and for Marylebone in 1886, and is the author of numerous
review articles on social and political topics, treated from
the positivist standpoint, especially on the Irish question. His
works also include a series of lectures on Roman history, entitled
<i>Catiline, Clodius, Tiberius</i> (1878), in which he rehabilitates in
some degree the character of each of his subjects, and <i>Queen
Elizabeth</i> (1892), in the &ldquo;Twelve English Statesmen&rdquo; series.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEET,<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> a cultivated form of the plant <i>Beta vulgaris</i> (natural
order Chenopodiaceae), which grows wild on the coasts of
Europe, North Africa and Asia as far as India. It is a biennial,
producing, like the carrot, a thick, fleshy tap-root during the first
year and a branched, leafy, flowering stem in the following season.
The small, green flowers are borne in clusters. A considerable
number of varieties are cultivated for use on account of their
large fleshy roots, under the names of mangel-wurzel or mangold,
field-beet and garden-beet. The cultivation of beet in relation
to the production of sugar, for which purpose certain varieties of
beet stand next in importance to the sugar cane, is dealt with
under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sugar</a></span>. The garden-beet has been cultivated from very
remote times as a salad plant, and for general use as a table
vegetable. The variety most generally grown has long, tapering,
carrot-shaped roots, the &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; of which is of a uniform deep
red colour throughout, and the leaves brownish red. It is boiled
and cut into slices for being eaten cold; and it is also prepared
as a pickle, as well as in various other forms. Beet is in much
more common use on the continent of Europe as a culinary
vegetable than in Great Britain, where it has, however, been
cultivated for upwards of two centuries. The white beet, <i>Beta
cicla</i>, is cultivated for the leaves, which are used as spinach.
The midribs and stalks of the leaves are also stewed and eaten as
sea-kale, under the name of Swiss chard. <i>B. cicla</i> is also
largely used as a decorative plant for its large, handsome
leaves, blood red or variegated in colour.</p>

<p>The beet prospers in a rich deep soil, well pulverized by the
spade. If manure is required, it should be deposited at the
bottom of the trench in preparing the ground. The seeds should
be sown in drills 15 ins. asunder, in April or early in May, and the
plants are afterwards to be thinned to about 8 in. apart in the
lines, but not more, as moderate-sized roots are preferable.
The plants should grow on till the end of October or later, when a
portion should be taken up for use, and the rest laid in in a
sheltered corner, and covered up from frost. The roots must not
be bruised and the leaves must be twisted off&mdash;not closely cut,
as they are then liable to bleed. In the north the crop may be
wholly taken up in autumn, and stored in a pit or cellar, beyond
reach of frost. If it is desired to have fresh roots early, the seeds
should be sown at the end of February or beginning of March;
and if a succession is required, a few more may be sown by the
end of March.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEETHOVEN, LUDWIG VAN<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> (1770-1827), German musical
composer, was baptized (probably, as was usual, the day after
birth) on the 17th of December 1770 at Bonn. His family is
traceable to a village near Louvain, in Belgium, in the 17th
century. In 1650 a lineal ancestor of the composer settled in
Antwerp. Beethoven&rsquo;s grandfather, Louis, quarrelled with his
family, came to Bonn in 1732, and became one of the court
musicians of the archbishop-elector of Cologne. He was a genial
man of estimable character, and though Ludwig van Beethoven
was only four years old when his grandfather died, he never
forgot him, but cherished his portrait to the end of his life.
Beethoven&rsquo;s father, a tenor singer at the archbishop-elector&rsquo;s
court, was of a rough and violent temper, not improved by his
passion for drink, nor by the dire poverty under which the
family laboured. He married Magdelina Leim or Laym, the
widow of a <i>vâlet-de-chambre</i> of the elector of Trier and daughter
of the chief cook at Ehrenbreitstein. Beethoven&rsquo;s father wished
to profit as early as possible by his son&rsquo;s talent, and accordingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page645" id="page645"></a>645</span>
began to give him a severe musical training, especially on the
violin, when he was only five years old, at about which time they
left the house in which he was born (515 Bonngasse, now preserved
as a Beethoven museum, with a magnificent collection of
manuscripts and relics). By the time Beethoven was nine his
father had no more to teach him, and he entered upon a perhaps
healthier course of clavier lessons under a singer named Pfeiffer.
A little general education was also edged in by a certain Zambona.
Van den Eeden, the court organist, and an old friend of his
grandfather, taught him the organ and the pianoforte, and so
rapid was Beethoven&rsquo;s progress that when C.G. Neefe succeeded
to Van den Eeden&rsquo;s post in 1781, he was soon able to allow the
boy to act as his deputy. With his permission Beethoven published
in 1783 his earliest extant composition, a set of variations
on a march by Dressler. The title-page states that they were
written in 1780 &ldquo;<i>par un jeune amateur Louis van Beethoven
âgé de dix ans</i>.&rdquo; Beethoven&rsquo;s father was very clumsy in his
unnecessary attempts to make an infant prodigy of his son;
for the ante-dating of this composition, implying the correct
date of birth, contradicts the post-dating of the date of birth
by which he tried to make out that the three sonatas Beethoven
wrote in the same year were by a boy of eleven. (Beethoven
for a long time believed that he was born in 1772, and the
certificate of his baptism hardly convinced him, because he
knew that he had an elder brother named Ludwig who died in
infancy.) In the same year, 1783, Beethoven was given the
post of cembalist in the Bonn theatre, and in 1784 his position
of assistant to Neefe became official. In a <i>catalogue raisonné</i> of
the new archbishop Max Franz&rsquo;s court musicians we find &ldquo;No.
14, Ludwig Beethoven&rdquo; described &ldquo;as of good capacity, still
young, of good, quiet behaviour and poor,&rdquo; while his father
(No. 8) &ldquo;has a completely worn-out voice, has long been in
service, is very poor, of fairly good behaviour, and married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the spring of 1787 Beethoven paid a short visit to Vienna,
where he astonished Mozart by his extemporizations and had a
few lessons from him. How he was enabled to afford this visit
is not clear. After three months the illness of his mother, to
whom he was devoted, brought him back. She died in July,
leaving a baby girl, one year old, who died in November. For
five more years Beethoven remained at Bonn supporting his
family, of which he had been since the age of fifteen practically
the head, as his father&rsquo;s bad habits steadily increased until in
1789 Ludwig was officially entrusted with his father&rsquo;s salary.
He had already made several lifelong friends at Bonn, of whom
the chief were Count Waldstein and Stephan Breuning; and his
prospects brightened as the archbishop-elector, in imitation of his
brother the emperor Joseph II., enlarged the scale of his artistic
munificence. By 1792 the archbishop-elector&rsquo;s attention was
thoroughly aroused to Beethoven&rsquo;s power, and he provided for
Beethoven&rsquo;s second visit to Vienna. The introductions he and
Count Waldstein gave to Beethoven, the prefix &ldquo;van&rdquo; in
Beethoven&rsquo;s name (which looked well though it was not really a
title of nobility), and above all the unequalled impressiveness
of his playing and extemporization, quickly secured his footing
with the exceptionally intelligent and musical aristocracy of
Vienna, who to the end of his life treated him with genuine
affection and respect, bearing with all the roughness of his
manners and temper, not as with the eccentricities of a fashionable
genius, but as with signs of the sufferings of a passionate
and noble nature.</p>

<p>Beethoven&rsquo;s life, though outwardly uneventful, was one of
the most pathetic of tragedies. His character has had the same
fascination for his biographers as it had for his friends, and
there is probably hardly any great man in history of whom more
is known and of whom so much of what is known is interesting.
Yet it is all too much a matter of detail and anecdote to admit
of chronological summarizing here, and for the disentangling of
its actual incidents we must refer the reader to Sir George
Grove&rsquo;s long and graphic article, &ldquo;Beethoven,&rdquo; in the <i>Dictionary
of Music and Musicians</i>, and to the monumental biography of
Thayer, who devoted his whole life to collecting materials.
These two biographical works, read in the spirit in which their
authors conceived them, will reveal, beneath a mass of distressing,
grotesque and sometimes sordid detail, a nobility of character
and unswerving devotion to the highest moral ideas throughout
every distress and temptation to which a passionate and totally
unpractical temper and the growing shadow of a terrible misfortune
could expose a man.</p>

<p>The man is surpassed only by his works, for in them he had
that mastery which was denied to him in what he himself calls
his attempt to &ldquo;grapple with fate.&rdquo; Such of his difficulties as
lay in his own character already showed themselves in his studies
with Haydn. Haydn, who seems to have heard of him on his
first visit to Vienna in 1787, passed through Bonn in July 1792,
and was so much struck by Beethoven that it was very likely at
his instigation that the archbishop sent Beethoven to Vienna to
study under him. But Beethoven did not get on well with him,
and found him perfunctory in correcting his exercises. Haydn
appreciated neither his manners nor the audacity of his free
compositions, and abandoned whatever intentions he may have
had of taking Beethoven with him to England in 1794. Beethoven
could do without sympathy, but a grounding in strict
counterpoint he felt to be a dire necessity, so he continued his
studies with Albrechtsberger, a mere grammarian who had the
poorest opinion of him, but who could, at all events, be depended
on to attend to his work. Almost every comment has been made
upon the relations between Haydn and Beethoven, except the
perfectly obvious one that Mozart died at the age of thirty-six,
just at the time Beethoven came to Vienna, and that Haydn, as is
perfectly well known, was profoundly shocked by the untimely
loss of the greatest musician he had ever known. At such a time
the undeniable clumsiness of Beethoven&rsquo;s efforts at academic
exercises would combine with his general tactlessness to confirm
Haydn in the belief that the sun had set for ever in the musical
world, and would incline him to view with disfavour those bold
features of style and form which the whole of his own artistic
development should naturally have predisposed him to welcome.
It is at least significant that those early works of Beethoven in
which Mozart&rsquo;s influence is most evident, such as the Septet,
aroused Haydn&rsquo;s open admiration, whereas he hardly approved
of the compositions like the sonatas, <i>op.</i> 2 (dedicated to him), in
which his own influence is stronger. Neither he nor Beethoven
was skilful in expressing himself except in music, and it is
impossible to tell what Haydn meant, or what Beethoven
thought he meant, in advising him not to publish the last and
finest of the three trios, <i>op</i>. 1. But even if he did not
mean that it was too daring for the public, it can hardly be expected that
he never contrasted the meteoric career of Mozart, who after a
miraculous boyhood had produced at the age of twenty-five
some of the greatest music Haydn had ever seen, with the slow
and painful development of his uncouth pupil, who at the same
age had hardly a dozen presentable works to his credit. It is
not clear that Haydn ever came to understand Beethoven, and
many years passed before Beethoven realized the greatness of
the master whose teaching had so disappointed him.</p>

<p>From the time Beethoven settled permanently in Vienna,
which he was soon induced to do by the kindness of his aristocratic
friends, the only noteworthy external features of his
career are the productions of his compositions. In spite of the
usual hostile criticism for obscurity, exaggeration and unpopularity,
his reputation became world-wide and by degrees actually
popular; nor did it ever decline, for as his later works became
notorious for their extravagance and unintelligibility his earlier
works became better understood. He was no man of business,
but, in a thoroughly unpractical way, he was suspicious and
exacting in money matters, which in his later years frequently
turned up in his conversation as a grievance, and at times,
especially during the depreciation of the Austrian currency
between 1808 and 1815, were a real anxiety to him. Nevertheless,
with a little more skill his external prosperity would have been
great. He was always a personage of importance, as is testified
by more than one amusing anecdote, like those of his walks with
Goethe and his half-ironical comments on the hats which flew
off more for him than for Goethe; and in 1815 it seemed as if the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page646" id="page646"></a>646</span>
summit of his fame was reached when his 7th symphony was
performed, together with a hastily-written cantata, <i>Der glorreiche
Augenblick</i> and the blazing piece of descriptive fireworks entitled
<i>Wellingtons Sieg oder die Schlacht bei Vittoria</i>, once popular
in England as the <i>Battle Symphony</i>. The occasion for this
performance was the congress of Vienna; and the government
placed the two halls of the Redouten-Saal at his disposal for
two nights, while he himself was allowed to invite all the
sovereigns of Europe. In the same year he received the freedom
of the city, an honour much valued by him. After that time his
immediate popularity, as far as new works were concerned, became
less eminent, as that of his more easy-going contemporaries
began to increase. Yet there was, not only in the emotional
power of his earlier works, but also in the known cause of his
increasing inability to appear in public, something that awakened
the best popular sensibilities; and when his two greatest and
most difficult works, the 9th symphony and parts of the <i>Missa
Solemnis</i>, were produced at a memorable concert in 1824, the
storm of applause was overwhelming, and the composer, who
was on the platform in order to give the time to the conductor,
had to be turned round by one of the singers in order to <i>see</i> it.</p>

<p>Signs of deafness had given him grave anxiety as early as
1708. For a long time he successfully concealed it from all but
his most intimate friends, while he consulted physicians and
quacks with eagerness; but neither quackery nor the best skill
of his time availed him, and it has been pointed out that the root
of the evil lay deeper than could have been supposed during his
lifetime. Although his constitution was magnificently strong
and his health was preserved by his passion for outdoor life,
a post-mortem examination revealed a very complicated state of
disorder, evidently dating almost from childhood (if not inherited)
and aggravated by lack of care and good food. The touching
document addressed to his brothers in 1802, and known as
his &ldquo;will,&rdquo; should be read in its entirety, as given by Thayer
(iv. 4). No verbal quotation short of the whole will do justice
to the overpowering outburst which runs almost in one long
unpunctuated sentence through the whole tragedy of Beethoven&rsquo;s
life, as he knew it then and foresaw it. He reproaches men for
their injustice in thinking and calling him pugnacious, stubborn
and misanthropical when they do not know that for six years
he has suffered from an incurable condition, aggravated by
incompetent doctors. He dwells upon his delight in human
society, from which he has had so early to isolate himself, but the
thought of which now fills him with dread as it makes him
realize his loss, not only in music but in all finer interchange of
ideas, and terrifies him lest the cause of his distress should appear.
He declares that, when those near him had heard a flute or a
singing shepherd while he heard nothing, he was only prevented
from taking his life by the thought of his art, but it seemed impossible
for him to leave the world until he had brought out
all that he felt to be in his power. He requests that after his
death his present doctor, if surviving, shall be asked to describe
his illness and to append it to this document in order that at
least then the world may be as far as possible reconciled with
him. He leaves his brothers his property, such as it is, and in
terms not less touching, if more conventional than the rest of
the document, he declares that his experience shows that only
virtue has preserved his life and his courage through all his
misery.</p>

<p>And, indeed, his art and his courage rose far above any level
attainable by those artists who are slaves to the &ldquo;personal
note,&rdquo; for his chief occupation at the time of this document was
his 2nd symphony, the most brilliant and triumphant piece
that had ever been written up to that time. On a smaller scale,
in which mastery was the more easily attainable as experiment
was more readily tested, Beethoven was sooner able to strike
a tragic note, and hence the process of growth in his style is
more readily traceable in the pianoforte works than in the larger
compositions which naturally represent a series of crowning
results. Only in his last period does the pianoforte cease to be
Beethoven&rsquo;s normal means of expression. Accordingly, if in
the discussion of Beethoven&rsquo;s works, with which we close this
article, we dwell rather more on the pianoforte sonatas than on
his greater works, it is not only because they are more easily
referred to by the general reader, but because they are actually
a key to his intellectual development, such as is afforded neither
by his life nor by the great works which are themselves the crowning
mystery and wonder of musical art.</p>

<p>Deafness causes inconvenience in conversation long before it
is noticeable in music, and in 1806 Beethoven could still conduct
his opera <i>Fidelio</i> and be much annoyed at the inattention to his
nuances; and his last appearance as a player was not until 1814,
when he made a great impression with his B flat trio, <i>op</i>. 97.
At the end of November 1822 an attempt to conduct proved
disastrous. The touching incident in 1824 has been described,
but up to the last Beethoven seems to have found or imagined
that ear-trumpets (of which a collection is now preserved at Bonn)
were of use to him in playing to himself, though his friends
were often pained when the pianoforte was badly out of tune,
and were overcome when Beethoven in soft passages did not make
the notes sound at all. The instrument sent him by Broadwood
in 1817-1818 gave him great pleasure and he answered it with
a characteristically cordial and quaint letter in the best of bad
French. His fame in England was often a source of great
comfort to him, especially in his last illness, when the London
Philharmonic Society, for which the 9th symphony was written
and a 10th symphony projected, sent him £100 in advance of
the proceeds of a benefit concert which he had begged them to
give, being in very straitened circumstances, as he would make
no use of the money he had deposited in the bank for his nephew.</p>

<p>This nephew was the cause of most of his anxiety and distress
in the last twelve years of his life. His brother, Kaspar Karl,
had often given him trouble; for example, by obtaining and
publishing some of Beethoven&rsquo;s early indiscretions, such as the
trio-variations, <i>op</i>. 44, the sonatas, <i>op</i>. 49, and other trifles,
of which the late <i>opus</i> number is thus explained. In 1815, after
Beethoven had quarrelled with his oldest friend, Stephan
Breuning, for warning him against trusting his brother in money
matters, Kaspar died, leaving a widow of whom Beethoven
strongly disapproved, and a son, nine years old, for the guardianship
of whom Beethoven fought the widow through all the law
courts. The boy turned out utterly unworthy of his uncle&rsquo;s
persistent devotion, and gave him every cause for anxiety.
He failed in all his examinations, including an attempt to learn
some trade in the polytechnic school, whereupon he fell into the
hands of the police for attempting suicide, and, after being
expelled from Vienna, joined the army. Beethoven&rsquo;s utterly
simple nature could neither educate nor understand a human
being who was not possessed by the wish to do his best. His
nature was passionately affectionate, and he had suffered all
his life from the want of a natural outlet for it. He had often
been deeply in love and made no secret of it; but Robert
Browning had not a more intense dislike of &ldquo;the artistic temperament&rdquo;
in morals, and though Beethoven&rsquo;s attachments were
almost all hopelessly above him in rank, there is not one that
was not honourable and respected by society as showing the
truthfulness and self-control of a great man. Beethoven&rsquo;s
orthodoxy in such matters has provoked the smiles of Philistines,
especially when it showed itself in his objections to Mozart&rsquo;s
<i>Don Giovanni</i>, and his grounds for selecting the subject of
<i>Fidelio</i> for his own opera. The last thing that Philistines will
ever understand is that genius is far too independent of convention
to abuse it; and Beethoven&rsquo;s life, with all its mistakes,
its grotesqueness and its pathos, is as far beyond the shafts of
Philistine wit as his art.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1827 Beethoven had projects for a 10th
symphony, music to Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>, and (under the stimulus
of his newly acquired collection of Handel&rsquo;s works) any amount
of choral music, compared to which all his previous compositions
would have seemed but a prelude. But he was in bad health;
his brother Johann, with whom he had been staying, had not
allowed him a fire in his bedroom, and had sent him back to
Vienna in an open chaise in vile weather; and the chill which
resulted ended in a fatal illness. Within a week of his death
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page647" id="page647"></a>647</span>
Beethoven was still full of his projects. Three days before the
end he added a codicil to his will, and saw Schubert, whose music
had aroused his keen interest, but was not able to speak to him,
though he afterwards spoke of the Philharmonic Society and the
English, almost his last words being &ldquo;God bless them.&rdquo; On the
26th of March 1827, during a fierce thunderstorm, he died.</p>

<p><i>Beethoven&rsquo;s Music.</i>&mdash;The division of Beethoven&rsquo;s work into
three styles has become proverbial, and is based on obvious facts.
The styles, however, are not rigidly separated, either in
themselves or in chronology. Nor can the popular description of
Beethoven&rsquo;s first manner as &ldquo;Mozartesque&rdquo; be accepted as
doing justice to a style which differs more radically from Mozart&rsquo;s
than Mozart&rsquo;s differs from Haydn&rsquo;s. The style of Beethoven&rsquo;s
third period is no longer regarded as &ldquo;showing an obscurity
traceable to his deafness,&rdquo; but we have, perhaps, only recently
outgrown the belief that his later treatment of form is revolutionary.
The peculiar interest and difficulty in tracing Beethoven&rsquo;s
artistic development is that the changes in the materials
and range of his art were as great as those in the form, so that he
appears in the light of a pioneer, while the art with which he
started was nevertheless already a perfectly mature and highly
organized thing. And he is perhaps unique among artists in
this, that his power of constructing perfect works of art never
deserted him while he revolutionized his means of expression.
No doubt this is in a measure true of all the greatest artists,
but it is seldom obvious. In mature art vital differences in
works of similar form are generally more likely to be overlooked
than to force themselves on the critic&rsquo;s attention. And when
they become so great as to make a new epoch it is generally
at the cost of a period of experiment too heterogeneous and
insecure for works of art to attain great permanent value.
But in Beethoven&rsquo;s case, as we have said, the process of development
is so smooth that it is impossible to separate the periods
clearly, although the ground covered is, as regards emotional
range, at least as great as that between Bach and Mozart. No
artist has ever left more authoritative documentary evidence
as to the steps of his development than Beethoven. In boyhood
he seems to have acquired the habit of noting down all his
musical ideas exactly as they first struck him. It is easy to see
why in later years he referred to this as a &ldquo;bad habit,&rdquo; for it
must often take longer to jot down a crude idea than to reject
it; and by the time the habit was formed Beethoven&rsquo;s powers of
self-criticism were unparalleled, and he must often have felt
hampered by the habit of writing down what he knew to be too
crude to be even an aid to memory. Such first intuitions, if not
written down, would no doubt be forgotten; but the poetic
mood, the <i>Stimmung</i>, they attempt to indicate, would remain
until a better expression was forthcoming. Beethoven had
acquired the habit of recording them, and thereby he has,
perhaps, misled some critics into over-emphasizing the contrast
between his &ldquo;tentative&rdquo; self-critical methods and the
quasi-extempore outpourings of Mozart. This contrast is probably
not very radical; indeed, we may doubt whether in every
thoughtful mind any apparently sudden inspiration is not
preceded by some anticipatory mood in which the idea was sought
and its first faint indications tested and rejected so
instantaneously as to leave no impression on the memory.</p>

<p>The number and triviality of Beethoven&rsquo;s preliminary sketches
should not, then, be taken as evidence of a timid or vacillating
spirit. But if we regard his sketches as his diary their significance
becomes inestimable. They cover every period of Beethoven&rsquo;s
career, and represent every stage of nearly all his important
works, as well as of innumerable trifles, including ideas that did
not survive to be worked out. And the type of self-criticism
is the same from beginning to end. There is no tendency in the
middle or last period, any more than in the first, to &ldquo;subordinate
form to expression,&rdquo; nor do the sketches of the first
period show any lack of attention to elements that seem more
characteristic of the third. The difference between Beethoven&rsquo;s
three styles appears first in its full proportions when we realize
this complete continuity of his method and art. We have ventured
to cast doubts upon the Mozartesque character of his early
style, because that is chiefly a question of perspective. While
he was handling a range of ideas not, in a modern view, glaringly
different from Mozart&rsquo;s, he had no reason to use a glaringly
different language. His contemporaries, however, found it more
difficult to see the resemblance; and, though their criticism was
often violently hostile, they saw with prejudice a daring originality
which we may as well learn to appreciate with study.
Beethoven himself in later years partly affected and partly felt
a lack of sympathy with his own early style. But he had other
things to do than to criticize it. Modern prejudice has not his
excuse, and the neglect of Beethoven&rsquo;s early works is no less
than the neglect of the key to the understanding of his later.
It is also the neglect of a mass of mature art that already places
Beethoven on the same plane as Mozart, and contains perhaps
the only traces in all his work of a real struggle between the
forces of progress and those of construction. We will therefore
give special attention to this subject here.</p>

<p>The truth is that there are several styles in Beethoven&rsquo;s
first period, in the centre of which, &ldquo;proving all things,&rdquo; is the
true and mature Beethoven, however wider may be the scope of
his later maturity. And he did not, as is often alleged, fail to
show early promise. The pianoforte quartets he wrote at the age
of fifteen are, no doubt, clumsy and childish in execution to a
degree that contrasts remarkably with the works of Mozart&rsquo;s,
Mendelssohn&rsquo;s or Schubert&rsquo;s boyhood; yet they contain material
actually used in the sonatas, <i>op</i>. 2, No. 1, and <i>op</i>. 2, No. 3. And
the passage in <i>op</i>. 2, No. 3, is that immediately after the first
subject, where, as Beethoven then states it, it embodies one of
his most epoch-making discoveries, namely, the art of organizing
a long series of apparently free modulations by means of a
systematic progression in the bass. In the childish quartet the
principle is only dimly felt, but it is nevertheless there as a
subconscious source of inspiration; and it afterwards gives
inevitable dramatic truth to such passages as the climax of the
development in the sonata, <i>op</i>. 57 (commonly called <i>Appassionata</i>),
and throughout the chaos of the mysterious introduction
to the C major string-quartet, <i>op</i>. 59, No. 3, prepares us for the
world of loveliness that arises from it.</p>

<p>Although with Beethoven the desire to express new thoughts
was thus invariably both stimulated and satisfied by the discovery
of the necessary new means of expression, he felt deeply
the danger of spoiling great ideas by inadequate execution;
and his first work in a new form or medium is, even if as late
as the Mass in C, <i>op</i>. 89, almost always unambitious. His
teachers had found him sceptical of authority, and never
convinced of the practical convenience of a rule until he had too
successfully courted disaster. But he appreciated the experience,
though he may have found it expensive, and traces of crudeness
in such early works as he did not disown are as rare as plagiarisms.
The first three pianoforte sonatas, <i>op</i>. 2. show the different
elements in Beethoven&rsquo;s early style as clearly as possible. Sir
Hubert Parry has aptly compared the opening of the sonata,
<i>op</i>. 2, No. 1, with that of the finale of Mozart&rsquo;s G minor symphony,
to show how much closer Beethoven&rsquo;s texture is. The
slow movement well illustrates the rare cases in which Beethoven
imitates Mozart to the detriment of his own proper richness
of tone and thought, while the finale in its central episode
brings a misapplied and somewhat diffuse structure in Mozart&rsquo;s
style into direct conflict with themes as &ldquo;Beethovenish&rdquo; in
their terseness as in their sombre passion. The second sonata is
flawless in execution, and entirely beyond the range of Haydn
and Mozart in harmonic and dramatic thought, except in the
finale. And it is just in the adoption of the luxurious
Mozartesque rondo form as the crown of this work that Beethoven
shows his true independence. He adopts the form, not because
it is Mozart&rsquo;s, but because it is right and because he can master it.
The opening of the second subject in the first movement is a
wonderful application of the harmonic principle already mentioned
in connexion with the early piano quartets. In all music
nothing equally dramatic can be found before the D minor
sonata, <i>op</i>. 31, No. 2, which is rightly regarded as marking the
beginning of Beethoven&rsquo;s second period. The slow movement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page648" id="page648"></a>648</span>
like those of <i>op</i>. 7 and a few other early works, shows a thrilling
solemnity that immediately proves the identity of the pupil of
Haydn with the creator of the 9th symphony. The little <i>scherzo</i>
no less clearly foreshadows the new era in music by the fact
that in so small and light a movement a modulation from A to G
sharp minor can occur too naturally to excite surprise. If the
later work of Beethoven were unknown there would be very
little evidence that this sonata was by a young man, except,
perhaps, in the remarkable abruptness of style in the first
movement, an abruptness which is characteristic, not of
immaturity, but of art in which problems are successfully solved
for the first time. This abruptness is, however, in a few of
Beethoven&rsquo;s early works carried appreciably too far. In the
sonata in C minor, <i>op</i>. 10, No. 1, for example, the more vigorous
parts of the first movement lose in breadth from it, while the
finalé is almost stunted.</p>

<p>But Beethoven was not content to express his individuality
only in an abrupt epigrammatic style. From the outset breadth
was also his aim, and while he occasionally attempted to attain
a greater breadth than his resources would properly allow (as
in the first movement of the sonata, <i>op</i>. 2, No. 3, and that of the
violoncello sonata, <i>op</i>. 5, No. 1, in both of which cases a kind of
extempore outburst in the coda conceals the collapse of his
peroration), there are many early works in which he shows
neither abruptness of style nor any tendency to confine himself
within the limits of previous art. The C minor trio, <i>op</i>. 1, No. 3,
is not more remarkable for the boldness of thought that made
Haydn doubtful as to the advisability of publishing it, than for
the perfect smoothness and spaciousness of its style. These
qualities Beethoven at first naturally found easier to retain with
less dramatic material, as in the other trios in the same <i>opus</i>,
but the C minor trio does not stand alone. It represents, perhaps,
the most numerous, as certainly the noblest, class of
Beethoven&rsquo;s early works. Certainly the smallest class is that
in which there is unmistakable imitation of Mozart, and it is
significant that almost all examples of this class are works for
wind instruments, where the technical limitations narrowly
determine the style and discourage the composer from taking
things seriously. Such works are the beautiful and popular
septet, the quintet for pianoforte and wind instruments (modelled
superficially, yet closely and with a kind of modest ambition, on
Mozart&rsquo;s wonderful work for the same combination) and, on a
somewhat higher level, the trio for pianoforte, clarinet and
violoncello, <i>op</i>. 11.</p>

<p>It is futile to discuss the point at which Beethoven&rsquo;s second
manner may be said to begin, but he has himself given us
excellent evidence as to when and how his first manner (as far as
that is a single thing) became impossible to him. Through quite
a large number of works, beginning perhaps with the great
string quintet, <i>op</i>. 29, new types of harmonic and emotional
expression had been assimilated into a style at least intelligible
from Mozart&rsquo;s point of view. Indeed, Beethoven&rsquo;s favourite
way of enlarging his range of expression often seems to consist in
allowing the Titanic force of his new inventions and the formal
beauty of the old art to indicate by their contrast a new world
grander and lovelier than either. Sometimes, as in the C major
quintet, the new elements are too perfectly assimilated for the
contrast to appear. The range of key and depth of thought is
beyond that of Beethoven&rsquo;s first manner, but the smoothness is
that of Mozart. In the three pianoforte sonatas, <i>op</i>. 31, the
struggle of the transition is as manifest as its accomplishment is
triumphant. The first movement of the first sonata (in G major)
deals with widely separated keys on new principles. These are
embodied in a style which for abruptness and jocular paradox
is hardly surpassed by Beethoven&rsquo;s most nervous early works.
The exceptionally ornate and dilatory slow movement reads
almost like a protest; while the finale begins as if to show that
humour should be beautiful, and ends by making fun of the
beauty. The second sonata (in D minor) is the greatest work
Beethoven had as yet written. Its first movement, already cited
above in connexion with the dramatic sequences in <i>op</i>. 2, No. 2,
is, like that of the <i>Sonata Appassionata</i>, a <i>locus classicus</i> for such
powerful means of expression. And it is worth noting that the
only sketch known of this movement is a sketch in which nothing
but its sequential plan is indicated. In the third sonata
Beethoven enjoys on a higher plane an experience he had often
indulged in before, the attainment of smoothness and breadth
by means of a delicately humorous calm which gives scope to the
finer subtleties of his new thoughts.</p>

<p>Beethoven himself wrote to his publisher that these three
sonatas represented a new phase in his style; but when we
realize his artistic conscientiousness it is not surprising that they
should be contemporary with larger works like the 2nd symphony,
which are far more characteristic of his first manner.
His whole development is entirely ruled by his determination to
let nothing pass until it has been completely mastered, and long
before this his sketch-books show that he had many ambitious
ideas for a 1st symphony, and that it was a deliberate process
that made his ambitions dwindle into something that could be
safely realized in the masterly little comedy with which he began
his orchestral career. The easy breadth and power of the 2nd
symphony represents an amply sufficient advance, and leaves
his forces free to develop in less expensive forms those vast
energies for which afterwards the orchestra and the string-quartet
were to become the natural field.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Waldstein&rdquo; sonata, <i>op</i>. 53, we see Beethoven&rsquo;s
second manner literally displacing his first; that is to say, we
reach a state of things at which the two can no longer form an
artistic contrast. The work, as we know it, is not only perfect,
but has all the qualities of art in which the newest elements have
long been familiar. The opening is on the same harmonic train
of thought as that of the sonata, <i>op</i>. 31, No. 1, but there is no
longer the slightest need for a paradoxical or jocular manner.
On the contrary, the harmonies are held together by an orderly
sequence in the bass, and the onrush is that of some calm diurnal
energy of nature. The short introduction to the finale is
harmonically and emotionally the most profound thing in the sonata,
while the finale itself uses every new resource in the triumphant
attainment of a leisure more splendid than any conceivable in
the most spacious of Mozart&rsquo;s rondos. Yet it is well known
that Beethoven originally intended the beautiful <i>andante</i> in F,
afterwards published separately, to be the slow movement of
this sonata. That andante is, like the finale, a spacious and
gorgeous rondo, which probably Beethoven himself could not
have written at an earlier period. The modulation to D flat in
its principal theme, and that to G flat near the end, are its chief
harmonic effects and stand out in beautiful relief within its
limits. After the first movement of the Waldstein sonata they
would be flat and colourless. The sketch-books show that
Beethoven, when he first planned the sonata, was by no means
inattentive to the balance of harmonic colour in the whole scheme,
but that at first he did not realize how far that scheme was
going to carry him. He originally thought of the slow movement
as in E major, a remote key to which, however, he soon assigned
the more intimate position of complementary key in the first
movement. He then worked at the slow movement in F with
such zest that he did not discover until the whole sonata was
finished that he had raised the first and last movements to an
altogether higher plane of thought, though the redundancy of
the two rondos in juxtaposition and the unusual length of the
sonata were so obvious that his friends ventured to point them
out. Beethoven&rsquo;s revision of his earliest works is now known
to have been extensive and drastic; but this is the first instance,
and <i>Fidelio</i> and the quartet in B flat, <i>op</i>. 131, are the only
other instances, of any later work needing important alteration after
it was completely executed. From this point up to <i>op</i>. 101 we
may study Beethoven&rsquo;s second manner entirely free from any
survivals of his first, even as a legitimate contrast; though it
is as impossible to fix a point before which his third manner
cannot be traced as it is to ignore the premonitions of his second
manner in his early works. The distinguishing features in
Beethoven&rsquo;s second style are the result of a condition of art in
which enormous new possibilities have become so well known that
there is no need for stating them abruptly, paradoxically or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page649" id="page649"></a>649</span>
emphatically, but also no need for working them out to remote
conclusions. Hence these works have become for most people
the best-known and best-loved type of classical music. In their
perfect fusion of untranslatable dramatic emotion with every
beauty of musical design and tone they have never been equalled,
nor is it probable that any other art can show a wider range of
thought embodied in a more perfect form. In music itself there
is nothing else of so wide a range without grave artistic defects
from which Beethoven is entirely free. Wagnerian opera aims
at an ideal as truly artistic, and in so far of wider range than
Beethoven&rsquo;s that it passes beyond the bounds of pure music
altogether. Within those bounds Beethoven remained, and
even the apparent exceptions (such as <i>Fidelio</i> and his two great
examples of &ldquo;programme music,&rdquo; the <i>Pastoral Symphony</i> and
the sonata, <i>Les Adieux</i>) only show how universal his conception
of pure music is. Extraneous ideas had here struck him as
magnificent material for instrumental music, and he never
troubled to argue whether instrumental music is the better
or worse for expressing extraneous ideas. To describe the works
of Beethoven&rsquo;s second period here would be to describe a library
of well-known classics, and we must refer the reader for further
details to the articles on <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sonata Forms</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Contrapuntal Forms</a></span>,
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Harmony</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Instrumentation</a></span>. It remains for us to attempt
to indicate the essential features of his third style, and to conclude
with a survey of his influence on the history of music.</p>

<p>Beethoven&rsquo;s third style arose imperceptibly from his second.
His deafness had very little to do with it, for all his epoch-making
discoveries in orchestral effect date from the time when he was
already far too much inconvenienced to test them in a way which
would satisfy any one who depended more upon his ear than upon
his imagination. It is indeed highly probable that there are no
important features in Beethoven&rsquo;s latest style that may not be
paralleled by the tendencies of all great artists who have handled
their material until it contains nothing that has not been long
familiar with them. Such tendencies lead to an extreme simplicity
of form, underlying an elaboration of detail which may at first
seem bewildering until we realize that it is purely the working out
to its logical conclusions of some idea as simple and natural as the
form itself. The form, however, will be not merely simple, but
individual. Different works will show such striking external
differences of form that a criticism which applies merely <i>a priori</i>
or historic standards will be tempted by the fallacy that there is
less form in a number of such markedly different works than in a
number of works that have one scheme in common. All this is
eminently the case with Beethoven&rsquo;s last works. The extreme
simplicity of the themes of the first two movements of the
quartet in B flat, <i>op</i>. 131, and the tremendous complexity of the
texture into which they are woven, at first impress us as something
mysterious and intangible rather than astonishing. The
boldness with which the slow introduction is blended in broad
statement and counter-statement with the <i>allegro</i>, is directly
impressive, as is also the entry of the second subject with its
dark harmony and tone, but the work needs long familiarity
before its vast mass of thought reveals itself to us in its true
lucidity. Such works are &ldquo;dark with excessive bright.&rdquo; When
we enter into them they are transparent as far as our vision
extends, and their darkness is that of a depth that shines as we
penetrate it. In all probability only a veil of familiarity prevents
our finding the same kind of difficulty in Beethoven&rsquo;s earlier
works. What is undoubtedly newest in the last works is the
enormous development of those polyphonic elements which are
always essential to the life of a composition, but which have
very different functions and degrees of prominence in different
forms and stages of the art. Polyphony inevitably draws
attention to detail, and thus Beethoven in his middle period
found its more obvious manifestations but little conducive to
the breadth of designs which were not as yet sufficiently familiar
to take any but the foremost place. Hence, among other
interesting features of that second period, his marked preference
for themes founded on rhythmic figures of one note, <i>e.g.</i> the
famous &ldquo;four taps&rdquo; in the C minor symphony; an identical
rhythm in a melodious theme of very different character in the
G major concerto; a similar figure in the <i>Sonata Appassionata</i>;
the first theme of the <i>scherzo</i> of the F major quartet, <i>op</i>. 59,
No. 1, and the drum-beats in the violin concerto. Such rhythms give
thematic life to an inner part without causing it to assume such
melodic interest as might distract the attention from the flow
of the surface. But in proportion as polyphony loses its danger
so does the prominence of such rhythmic figures decrease, until
in Beethoven&rsquo;s last works they are no more noticeable than other
kinds of simplicity. The impression of crowded detail is naturally
more prominent the smaller the means with which Beethoven
works and the less outwardly dramatic his thought. Thus
those most gigantic of all musical designs, the 9th symphony,
and the Mass in D, are, but for the mechanical difficulties of the
choral writing, almost like works of the second period as far as
direct impressiveness is concerned; and in the same way the
enormous pianoforte sonata, <i>op</i>. 106, is in its first three movements
easier to follow than the extremely terse and subtle works
on a smaller scale that preceded it (sonata in A major, 101, and
the two sonatas for violoncello, <i>op</i>. 102).</p>

<p>His enormous development of polyphonic interest soon led
Beethoven to employ the fugue, not only, as in previous works,
by way of episodic contrast to passages and designs in which the
form and not the texture is the main object of interest, but as
the culminating expression of a condition or art in which the
unity of form and texture is so perfect that the mind is free to
concentrate itself on the texture alone. This union was not
effected without a struggle, the traces of which present a close
parallel to that abrupt emphasis which we noticed in some of
Beethoven&rsquo;s early works. In his fugue-writing the notion that
the chief interest lies in the texture is as yet so difficult to hold
together with the perception that these fugues are based on a
modern firmness and range of form, that the texture is forced
upon the listener&rsquo;s attention by a continual series of ruthlessly
logical bold strokes of harmony. From this and from the
notorious violence of Beethoven&rsquo;s choral writing, and also from
his well-known technical struggles in his years of pupilage, the
easy inference has been drawn that Beethoven never was a great
master of counterpoint, an inference that is absolutely irreconcilable
with such plain facts as, to take but one early example, the
brilliant piece of triple counterpoint in the <i>andante</i> of the string
quartet in C minor, <i>op</i>. 18, No. 4, and the complete absence of
anything like crudeness in his handling of harmonics, basses or
inner parts at any period of his career. Beethoven may have
mastered some things with difficulty, but he mastered nothing
incompletely; and where he is not orthodox it is safest to
conclude that orthodoxy is wrong. Had he lived for another
ten years he would certainly have produced an immense amount
of choral work, and with it many other great instrumental works
in which this last remaining element of conflict between texture
and form would have dwindled away. But while this would
doubtless result in such work being easier to follow and might
even have given us a version of the great fugue, <i>op</i>. 133 (discarded
from the string-quartet, <i>op</i>. 131), that did not surpass the bounds
of practical performance, it would yet be no sound criterion by
which to stigmatize as an immaturity the roughness of the
polyphonic works that we know. That roughness is, like the
abrupt epigrammatic manner of some of his early works, the
necessary condition in which such material realizes mature
expression. Without it that material could receive but the
academic handling of a dead language. And by it was created
that permanent reconciliation of polyphony and form from which
has arisen almost all that is true in &ldquo;Romantic&rdquo; music, all that
is peculiar to the thematic technique of Wagnerian opera, and
all the perfect smoothness of Brahms&rsquo;s polyphony.</p>

<p>The incalculable depth of thought and closeness of texture in
Beethoven&rsquo;s later works are, of course, the embodiment of a no
less incalculable emotional power. If we at times feel that the
last quartets are more introspective than dramatic, that is
only because Beethoven&rsquo;s dramatic sense is higher than we can
realize. The subject is too large and too subtle for dogmatism
to be profitable; and we cannot in Beethoven&rsquo;s case, as we can
in Bach&rsquo;s, cite a complete series of illustrations of his musical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page650" id="page650"></a>650</span>
ideas from his treatment in choral music of words which themselves
interpret the intention of the composer. There is so little
but the music itself by which one can express Beethoven&rsquo;s
thought, that the utmost we can do here is to refer the reader,
as before, to the articles on <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sonata Forms</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Harmony</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Instrumentation</a></span>,
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Opera</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Music</a></span>, where he will find further
attempts to indicate in what sense pure music can be described
as dramatic and expressive of emotion.</p>

<p>As our range of investigation widens, and thoroughness of
analysis and study increases, so we shall surely find in ourselves
an ever-deepening conviction that Beethoven, whether in range,
depth and truth of thought, perfect sense of beauty, or absolute
conscientiousness of execution, is the greatest musician, perhaps
the greatest artist, that ever lived. There is no means of
measuring Beethoven&rsquo;s influence upon subsequent music. Every
composer of every school claims it. The immense changes he
brought about in the range of music have their most obvious
effect in the possibilities of emotional expression; and so any
outbreak of vulgarity or sentimentality can with impunity claim
descent from Beethoven, though its ancestry may be no higher
than Meyerbeer. Again, we have already referred to that
confusion of thought which regards a series of works markedly
different in form as containing less form than any number of
works cast in one mould. Hence the works of Beethoven&rsquo;s third
period have been cited in defence of more than one &ldquo;revolution,&rdquo;
attempted in a form which never existed in any true classic, for
the purpose of setting up something the revolutionist has not yet
succeeded in inventing. To measure Beethoven&rsquo;s influence is
like measuring Shakespeare&rsquo;s. It is an influence either too
vaguely universal to name or too profoundly artistic to analyse.
Perhaps the truest account of it would be that which ignored its
presence in the works of ill-balanced artists, or even in the works of
those who profited merely by an increase of technical and harmonic
resource which, though effected by Beethoven, would, after the
French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars, almost certainly
have to some extent arisen from sheer necessity of finding
expression for the new experience of humanity, if Beethoven had
never existed. Setting aside, then, all instances of mere
domination, and of a permanently established new world of musical
thought, and omitting Schubert and Weber as contemporaries,
the one attracted and the other partly repelled, we may, perhaps,
take three later composers, Schumann, Wagner and Brahms, as
the leading examples of the way in which Beethoven&rsquo;s influence
is definitely traceable as a creative force. The depth and
solemnity of Beethoven&rsquo;s melody and later polyphonic richness
is a leading source of Schumann&rsquo;s inspiration, though Schumann&rsquo;s
artistic schemes exclude any high degree of formal organization
on a large scale. Beethoven&rsquo;s late polyphony is carried on by
Brahms to the point at which perfect smoothness of style is once
more possible, and there is no aspect of his form which Brahms
neglects or fails to realize with that complete originality which
has nothing to fear from its ancestry. Wagner does not handle
the same art-forms; his task is different, but Beethoven was the
inspiring source, not only of his purely musical sense, but also of
his whole sense of dramatic contrast and fitness. When he had
shaken off the influence of Meyerbeer, which has so often been
confused with that of Beethoven, there remained to him, pre-eminently
in his music and more imperfectly realized in his drama,
a power of combining contrasted emotions such as is the privilege
of only the very greatest dramatic artists. Bach and Beethoven
are the sources of the polyphonic means of expression by which
he attains this. Beethoven alone is the extraneous source of his
knowledge that it was possible. And it is as certain as anything
in the history of art that there will never be a time when
Beethoven&rsquo;s work does not occupy the central place in a sound
musical mind.</p>

        beginnings and breakings off of themes, as if in search for
        a firm idea, which is at last found and developed as a set

<p><span class="bold">BEETLE<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> (O. Eng. <i>bityl</i>; connected with &ldquo;bite&rdquo;), a name
commonly applied to those insects which possess horny wing-cases;
it is used to denote the cockroaches (<i>q.v.</i>) (black beetles),
as well as the true beetles or <i>Coleoptera</i> (<i>q.v.</i>), the two belonging

<p>The adjective &ldquo;beetle-browed,&rdquo; and similarly &ldquo;beetling&rdquo;

<p><span class="bold">BEETS, NIKOLAAS<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> (1814-1903), Dutch poet, was born at
Haarlem on the 13th of September 1814; constant references
in his poems and sketches show how deeply the beauty of that
town and its neighbourhood impressed his imagination. He
studied theology in Leiden, but gave himself early to the cultivation
of poetry. In his youth Beets was entirely carried away
on the tide of Byronism which was then sweeping over Europe,
and his early works&mdash;<i>Jose</i> (1834), <i>Kuser</i> (1835) and <i>Guy de
Vlaming</i> (1837)&mdash;are gloomy romances of the most impassioned
type. But at the very same time he was beginning in prose the
composite work of humour and observation which has made him
famous, and which certainly had nothing that was in the least
Byronic about it. This was the celebrated <i>Camera Obscura</i> (1839),
the most successful imaginative work which any Dutchman
of the 18th century produced. This work, published under
the pseudonym of &ldquo;Hildebrand,&rdquo; goes back in its earliest
inception to the year 1835, when Beets was only twenty-one.
It consists of complete short stories, descriptive sketches, studies
of peasant life&mdash;all instinct with humour and pathos, and
written in a style of great charm; it has been reprinted in
countless editions. Beets became a professor at the university
of Leiden, and the pastor of a congregation in that city. In
middle life he published further collections of verse&mdash;<i>Cornflowers</i>
(1853) and <i>New Poems</i> (1857)&mdash;in which the romantic melancholy
was found to have disappeared, and to have left in its place a
gentle sentiment and a depth of religious feeling. In 1873-1875
Beets collected his works in three volumes. In April 1883 the
honorary degree of LL.D. Edin. was conferred upon him. He
died at Utrecht on the 13th of March 1903.</p>

Italian female counterpart of Santa Claus, the Christmas benefactor
(St Nicholas). On Epiphany, or Twelfth Night, she plays
the fairy godmother to the children, filling their stockings with
presents. Tradition relates that she was too busy with house
duties to come to the window to see the Three Wise Men of the
East pass on their journey to pay adoration to the Saviour,
excusing herself on the ground that she could see them on their
return. They went back another way, and Befana is alleged
to have been punished by being obliged to look for them for
ever. Her legends seem to be rather mixed, for in spite of her
Santa Claus character, her name is used by Italian mothers as a
bogey to frighten the babies. It was the custom to carry her
effigy through Italian towns on the eve of the Epiphany.</p>

dramatist and man of letters, was born at Laon on the 6th of
November 1757. Under the name of &ldquo;Cousin Jacques&rdquo; he founded
a periodical called <i>Les Lunes</i> (1785-1787). The <i>Courrier
des planètes ou Correspondance du Cousin Jacques avec le firmament</i>
(1788-1792) followed. <i>Nicodème dans la lune, ou la révolution
pacifique</i> (1790) a three-act farce, is said to have had more
than four hundred representations. In spite of his protests
against the evils of the Revolution he escaped interference
through the influence of his brother, Louis Étienne Beffroy, who
was a member of the Convention. Of <i>La Petite Nanette</i> (1795)
and several other operas he wrote both the words and the music.
His <i>Dictionnaire néologique</i> (3 vols., 1795-1800) of the chief
actors and events in the Revolution was interdicted by the
police and remained incomplete. Beffroy spent his last years
in retirement, dying in Paris on the 17th of December 1811.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEGAS, KARL<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> (1794-1854), German historical painter, was
born at Heinsberg near Aix-la-Chapelle. His father, a retired
judge, destined him for the legal profession, but the boy&rsquo;s tastes
pointed definitely in another direction. Even at school he was
remarked for his wonderful skill in drawing and painting, and in
1812 he was permitted to visit Paris in order to perfect himself
in his art. He studied for eighteen months in the atelier of Gros
and then began to work independently. In 1814 his copy of
the Madonna della Sedia was bought by the king of Prussia,
who was attracted by the young artist and did much to advance
him. He was engaged to paint several large Biblical pictures,
and in 1825, after his return from Italy, continued to produce
paintings which were placed in the churches of Berlin and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page652" id="page652"></a>652</span>
Potsdam. Some of these were historical pieces, but the majority
were representations of Scriptural incidents. Begas was also
celebrated as a portrait-painter, and supplied to the royal gallery
a long series of portraits of eminent Prussian men of letters.
At his death he held the post of court painter at Berlin. His
son <span class="sc">Oskar</span> (1828-1883) was also a painter and professor of
painting at Berlin. <span class="sc">Reinhold</span>, the sculptor, is noticed below.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEGAS, REINHOLD<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> (1831-&emsp;&emsp;), German sculptor, younger
son of Karl Begas, the painter, was born at Berlin on the 15th of
July 1831. He received his early education (1846-1851) in the
ateliers of C.D. Rauch and L. Wichmann. During a period of
study in Italy, from 1856 to 1858, he was influenced by Böcklin
and Lenbach in the direction of a naturalistic style in sculpture.
This tendency was marked in the group &ldquo;Borussia,&rdquo; executed
for the façade of the exchange in Berlin, which first brought
him into general notice. In 1861 he was appointed professor
at the art school at Weimar, but retained the appointment only
a few months. That he was chosen, after competition, to execute
the statue of Schiller for the Gendarmen Markt in Berlin, was a
high tribute to the fame he had already acquired; and the result,
one of the finest statues in the German metropolis, entirely
justified his selection. Since the year 1870, Begas has entirely
dominated the plastic art in Prussia, but especially in Berlin.
Among his chief works during this period are the colossal statue
of Borussia for the Hall of Glory; the Neptune fountain in
bronze on the Schlossplatz; the statue of Alexander von Humboldt,
all in Berlin; the sarcophagus of the emperor Frederick
III. in the mausoleum of the Friedenskirche at Potsdam; and,
lastly, the national monument to the emperor William (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Berlin</a></span>), the statue of Bismarck before the Reichstag building,
and several of the statues in the Siegesallee. He was also entrusted
with the execution of the sarcophagus of the empress Frederick.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEGGAR,<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> one who begs, particularly one who gains his living
by asking the charitable contributions of others. The word,
with the verbal form &ldquo;to beg,&rdquo; in Middle English <i>beggen</i>, is of
obscure history. The words appear first in English in the 13th
century, and were early connected with &ldquo;bag,&rdquo; with reference
to the receptacle for alms carried by the beggars. The most
probable derivation of the word, and that now generally accepted,
is that it is a corruption of the name of the lay communities
known as Beguines and Beghards, which, shortly after their
establishment, followed the friars in the practice of mendicancy
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Beguines</a></span>). It has been suggested, however, that the
origin of &ldquo;beg&rdquo; and &ldquo;beggars&rdquo; is to be found in a rare Old
English word, <i>bedecian</i>, of the same meaning, which is apparently
connected with the Gothic <i>bidjan</i>, cf. German <i>betteln</i>; but
between the occurrence of <i>bedecian</i> at the end of the 9th century
and the appearance of &ldquo;beggar&rdquo; and &ldquo;beg&rdquo; in the 13th, there
is a blank, and no explanation can be given of the great change
in form. For the English law relating to begging and its history,

pack is divided equally between two players, and the cards are
held with the backs upwards. The first player lays down his
top card face up, and the opponent plays his top card on it,
and this goes on alternately as long as no court-card appears;
but if either player turns up a court-card, his opponent has to
play four ordinary cards to an ace, three to a king, two to a
queen, one to a knave, and when he has done so the other player
takes all the cards on the table and places them under his pack;
if, however, in the course of this playing to a court-card, another
court-card turns up, the adversary has in turn to play to this, and
as long as neither has played a full number of ordinary cards to
any court-card the trick continues. The player who gets all the
cards into his hand is the winner.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEGONIA<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> (named from M. Begon, a French patron of botany),
a large genus (natural order, Begoniaceae) of succulent herbs or
undershrubs, with about three hundred and fifty species in
tropical moist climates, especially South America and India.
About one hundred and fifty species are known in cultivation,
and innumerable varieties and hybrid forms. Many are tuberous.
The flowers are usually showy and large, white, rose, scarlet
or yellow in colour; they are unisexual, the male containing
numerous stamens, the female having a large inferior ovary and
two to four branched or twisted stigmas. The fruit is a winged
capsule containing numerous minute seeds. The leaves, which are
often large and variegated, are unequal-sided.</p>

<p>Cuttings from flowering begonias root freely in sandy soil,
if placed in heat at any season when moderately firm; as soon
as rooted, they should be potted singly into 3-in. pots, in sandy
loam mixed with leaf-mould and sand. They should be stopped
to keep them bushy, placed in a light situation, and thinly
shaded in the middle of very bright days. In a few weeks they
will require another shift. They should not be overpotted, but
instead assisted by manure water. The pots should be placed
in a light pit near the roof glass. The summer-flowering kinds
will soon begin blooming, but the autumn and winter flowering
sorts should be kept growing on in a temperature of from 55° to
60° by night, with a few degrees more in the day. The tuberous-rooted
sorts require to be kept at rest in winter, in a medium
temperature, almost but not quite dry. In February they should
be potted in a compost of sandy loam and leaf-mould, and placed
in a temperate pit until May or June, when they may be moved
to the greenhouse for flowering. If they afterwards get at all
pot-bound, weak manure should be applied. After blooming,
the supply of water must be again slackened; in winter the
plants should be stored in a dry place secure from frost; they
are increased by late summer and autumn cuttings, after being
partially cut down.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEGUINES<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> (Fr. <i>béguine</i>, Med. Lat. <i>beguina, begina, beghina</i>),
at the present time the name of the members of certain lay
sisterhoods established in the Netherlands and Germany, the
enclosed district within which they live being known as a beguinage
(Lat. <i>beginagium</i>). The equivalent male communities,
called also Beguines (Fr. <i>béguins</i>, Lat. <i>beguiní</i>), but more usually
Beghards (Lat. <i>baghardi, beggardi, begehardi</i>, &amp;c., O. Fr. <i>bégard-i</i>,
Flem. <i>beggaert</i>), have long ceased to exist. The origin of the
names Beguine and Beghard has been the subject of much
controversy. In the 15th century a legend arose that both name
and organization were traceable to St Begga, daughter of Pippin
of Landen, who consequently in 1630 was chosen by the Beguines
as the patron saint of their association. In 1630 a professor of
Louvain, Erycius Puteanus (van Putte), published a treatise,
<i>De Begginarum apud Belgas instituto et nomine suffragium</i>, in
which he produced three documents purporting to date from
the 11th and 12th centuries, which seemed conclusively to prove
that the Beguines existed long before Lambert le Bègue. For
two centuries these were accepted as genuine and are admitted
as such even in the monumental work of Mosheim. In 1843,
however, they were conclusively proved by the German scholar
Hallmann, from internal evidence, to be forgeries of the 14th and
15th centuries. It is now universally admitted that both the
institution and the name of the Beguines are derived from
Lambert le Bègue, who died about the year 1187. The confusion
caused by the spurious documents of Puteanus, however, led,
even when the legend of St Begga was rejected, to other suggestions
for the derivation of the name, <i>e.g.</i> from an imaginary old
Saxon word <i>beggen</i>, &ldquo;to beg&rdquo; or &ldquo;pray,&rdquo; an explanation
adopted even by Mosheim, or from <i>bègue</i>, &ldquo;stammering,&rdquo; a
French word of unknown origin, which only brings us back to
Lambert again, whose name of Le Bègue, as the chronicler
Aegidius, a monk of Orval (Aureae Vallis), tells us, simply
means &ldquo;the stammerer,&rdquo; <i>quia balbus erat</i> (<i>Gesta pontificum
Leodiensium</i>, <i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1251). Doubtless this coincidence gave
a ready handle to the scoffing wits of the time, and among the
numerous popular names given to the Beghards&mdash;<i>bons garçons,
boni pueri, boni valeti</i> and the like&mdash;we find also that of Lollards
(from Flemish <i>löllen</i>, &ldquo;to stammer&rdquo;).</p>

<p>About the year 1170 Lambert le Bègue, a priest of Liége,
who had devoted his fortune to founding the hospital and church
of St Christopher for the widows and children of crusaders,
conceived the idea of establishing an association of women, who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page653" id="page653"></a>653</span>
without taking the monastic vows, should devote themselves
to a life of religion. The effect of his preaching was immense, and
large numbers of women, many of them left desolate by the loss
of their husbands on crusade, came under the influence of a
movement which was attended with all the manifestations of
what is now called a &ldquo;revival.&rdquo; About the year 1180 Lambert
gathered some of these women, who had been ironically styled
&ldquo;Beguines&rdquo; by his opponents, into a semi-conventual community,
which he established in a quarter of the city belonging
to him around his church of St Christopher. The district was
surrounded by a wall within which the Beguines lived in separate
small houses, subject to no rule save the obligation of good
works, and of chastity so long as they remained members of the
community. After Lambert&rsquo;s death (<i>c</i>. 1187?) the movement
rapidly spread, first in the Netherlands and afterwards in France&mdash;where
it was encouraged by the saintly Louis IX.&mdash;Germany,
Switzerland and the countries beyond. Everywhere the community
was modelled on the type established at Liége. It
constituted a little city within the city, with separate houses,
and usually a church, hospital and guest-house, the whole being
under the government of a mistress (<i>magistra</i>). Women of all
classes were admitted; and, though there was no rule of poverty,
many wealthy women devoted their riches to the common cause.
The Beguines did not beg; and, when the endowments of the
community were not sufficient, the poorer members had to support
themselves by manual work, sick-nursing and the like.</p>

<p>The Beguine communities were fruitful soil for the missionary
enterprise of the friars, and in the course of the 13th century the
communities in France, Germany and upper Italy had fallen
under the influence of the Dominicans and Franciscans to such an
extent that in the Latin-speaking countries the tertiaries of these
orders were commonly called <i>beguini</i> and <i>beguinae</i>. The very
looseness of their organization, indeed, made it inevitable that
the Beguine associations should follow very diverse developments.
Some of them retained their original character; others
fell completely under the dominion of the friars, and were ultimately
converted into houses of Dominican, Franciscan or
Augustinian tertiaries; others again fell under the influence of
the mystic movements of the 13th century, turned in increasing
numbers from work to mendicancy (as being nearer the Christ-life),
practised the most cruel self-tortures, and lapsed into extravagant
heresies that called down upon them the condemnation of popes
and councils.<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> All this tended to lower the reputation of the
Beguines. During the 14th century, indeed, numerous new
beguinages were established; but ladies of rank and wealth
ceased to enter them, and they tended to become more and more
mere almshouses for poor women. By the 15th century in many
cases they had utterly sunk in reputation, their obligation to
nurse the sick was quite neglected, and they had, rightly or
wrongly, acquired the reputation of being mere nests of beggars
and women of ill fame. At the Reformation the communities
were suppressed in Protestant countries, but in some Catholic
countries they still survive. The beguinages found here and
there in Germany are now simply almshouses for poor spinsters,
those in Holland (<i>e.g.</i> at Amsterdam and Breda) and Belgium
preserve more faithfully the characteristics of earlier days.
The beguinage of St Elizabeth at Ghent has some thousand
sisters, and occupies quite a distinct quarter of the city, being
surrounded by a wall and moat. The Beguines wear the old
Flemish head-dress and a dark costume, and are conspicuous
for their kindness among the poor and their sick nursing.</p>

<p>It is uncertain whether the parallel communities of men
originated also with Lambert le Bègue. The first records are of
communities at Louvain in 1220 and at Antwerp in 1228. The
history of the male communities is to a certain extent parallel
with the female, but they were never so numerous and their
degeneration was far more rapid. The earliest Flemish Beghard
communities were associations mainly of artisans who earned
their living by weaving and the like, and appear to have been in
intimate connexion with the craft-gilds; but under the influence
of the mendicant movement of the 13th century these tended
to break up, and, though certain of the male beguinages survived
or were incorporated as tertiaries in the orders of friars, the name
of Beghard became associated with groups of wandering mendicants
who made religion a cloak for living on charity; <i>béguigner</i>
becoming in the French language of the time synonymous with
&ldquo;to beg,&rdquo; and <i>beghard</i> with &ldquo;beggar,&rdquo; a word which, according
to the latest authorities, was probably imported into England
in the 13th century from this source (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Beggar</a></span>). More serious
still, from the point of view of the Church, was the association of
these wandering mendicants with the mystic heresies of the
Fraticelli, the Apostolici and the pantheistic Brethren of the
Free Spirit. The situation was embittered by the hatred of the
secular clergy for the friars, with whom the Beguines were
associated. Restrictions were placed upon them by the synod
of Fritzlar (1269), by that of Mainz (1281) and Eichstätt (1281).
and by the synod of Béziers (1299) they were absolutely forbidden.
They were again condemned by a synod held at Cologne
in 1306; and at the synod of Trier in 1310 a decree was passed
against those &ldquo;who under a pretext of feigned religion call
themselves Beghards ... and, hating manual labour, go about
begging, holding conventicles and posing among simple people
as interpreters of the Scriptures.&rdquo; Matters came to a climax at
the council of Vienne in 1311 under Pope Clement V., where the
&ldquo;sect of Beguines and Beghards&rdquo; were accused of being the
main instruments of the spread of heresy, and decrees were
passed suppressing their organization and demanding their
severe punishment. The decrees were put into execution by
Pope John XXII., and a persecution raged in which, though the
pope expressly protected the female Beguine communities of the
Netherlands, there was little discrimination between the orthodox
and unorthodox Beguines. This led to the utmost confusion,
the laity in many cases taking the part of the Beguine communities,
and the Church being thus brought into conflict with
the secular authorities. In these circumstances the persecution
died down; it was, however, again resumed between 1366 and
1378 by Popes Urban V. and Gregory XI., and the Beguines were
not formally reinstated until the pontificate of Eugenius IV.
(1431-1447). The male communities did not survive the 14th
century, even in the Netherlands, where they had maintained
their original character least impaired.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEHAIM<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Behem</span>), <b>MARTIN</b> (1436?-1507), a navigator
and geographer of great pretensions, was born at Nuremberg,
according to one tradition, about 1436; according to Ghillany,
as late as 1459. He was drawn to Portugal by participation in
Flanders trade, and acquired a scientific reputation at the court
of John II. As a pupil, real or supposed, of the astronomer
&ldquo;Regiomontanus&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> Johann Müller of Königsberg in Franconia)
he became (<i>c.</i> 1480) a member of a council appointed by
King John for the furtherance of navigation. His alleged introduction
of the cross-staff into Portugal (an invention described
by the Spanish Jew, Levi ben Gerson, in the 14th century) is
a matter of controversy; his improvements in the astrolabe
were perhaps limited to the introduction of handy brass instruments
in place of cumbrous wooden ones; it seems likely that
he helped to prepare better navigation tables than had yet been
known in the Peninsula. In 1484-1485 he claimed to have
accompanied Diogo Cão in his second expedition to West Africa,
really undertaken in 1485-86, reaching Cabo Negro in 15° 40&prime; S.
and Cabo Ledo still farther on. It is now disputed whether
Behaim&rsquo;s pretensions here deserve any belief; and it is suggested
that instead of sharing in this great voyage of discovery, the
Nuremberger only sailed to the nearer coasts of Guinea, perhaps
as far as the Bight of Benin, and possibly with José Visinho the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page654" id="page654"></a>654</span>
astronomer and with João Affonso d&rsquo;Aveiro, in 1484-86. Martin&rsquo;s
later history, as traditionally recorded, was as follows. On his
return from his West African exploration to Lisbon he was
knighted by King John, who afterwards employed him in various
capacities; but, from the time of his marriage in 1486, he usually
resided at Fayal in the Azores, where his father-in-law, Jobst
van Huerter, was governor of a Flemish colony. On a visit to
his native city in 1492, he constructed his famous terrestrial
globe, still preserved in Nuremberg, and often reproduced, in
which the influence of Ptolemy is strongly apparent, but wherein
some attempt is also made to incorporate the discoveries of the
later middle ages (Marco Polo, &amp;c.). The antiquity of this globe
and the year of its execution, on the eve of the discovery of
America, are noteworthy; but as a scientific work it is unimportant,
ranking far below the <i>portolani</i> charts of the 14th century.
Its West Africa is marvellously incorrect; the Cape Verde
archipelago lies hundreds of miles out of its proper place; and
the Atlantic is filled with fabulous islands. Blunders of 16°
are found in the localization of places the author claims to have
visited: contemporary maps, at least in regard to continental
features, seldom went wrong beyond 1°. It is generally agreed
that Behaim had no share in Transatlantic discovery; and
though Columbus and he were apparently in Portugal at the
same time, no connexion between the two has been established.
He died at Lisbon in 1507.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEHAR,<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Bihar</span>, a town of British India, in the Patna
district of Bengal, which gives its name to an old province,
situated on the right bank of the river Panchana. Pop. (1901)
45,063. There are still some manufactures of silk and muslin,
but trade has deserted Behar in favour of Patna and other
places more favourably situated on the river Ganges and the
railway, while the indigo industry has been ruined by the
synthetic products of the German chemist, and the English
colony of indigo planters has been scattered abroad.</p>

<p>The old province, stretching widely across the valley of the
Ganges from the frontier of Nepal to the hills of Chota Nagpur,
corresponds to the two administrative divisions of Patna and
Bhagalpur, with a total area of 44,197 sq. m. and a population
of 24,241,305. It is the most densely populated tract in India,
and therefore always liable to famine; but it is now well
protected almost everywhere by railways. It is a country of large
landholders and formerly of indigo planters. The vernacular
language is not Bengali, but a dialect of Hindu; and the people
likewise resemble those of Upper India. The general aspect
of the country is flat, except in the district of Monghyr, where
detached hills occur, and in the south-east of the province,
where the Rajmahal and Santal ranges abut upon the plains.</p>

<p>Behar abounds in great rivers, such as the Ganges, with its
tributaries, the Ghagra, Gandak, Kusi, Mahananda and Sone.
The Ganges enters the province near the town of Buxar, flows
eastward and, passing the towns of Dinajpur, Patna, Monghyr
and Colgong, leaves the province at Rajmahal. It divides the
province into two almost equal portions; north of the river lie
the districts of Saran, Champaran, Tirhoot, Purnea, and part of
Monghyr and Bhagalpur, and south of it are Shahabad, Patna,
Gaya, the Santal parganas, and the rest of Monghyr and Bhagalpur.
The Ganges and its northern tributaries are navigable by
country boats of large burden all the year round. The cultivation
of opium is a government monopoly, and no person is allowed to
grow the poppy except on account of government. The Behar
Opium Agency has its headquarters at the town of Patna.
Annual engagements are entered into by the cultivators, under a
system of pecuniary advances, to sow a certain quantity of land
with poppy, and the whole produce in the form of opium is
delivered to government at a fixed rate.</p>

<p>Saltpetre is largely refined in Tirhoot, Saran and Champaran,
and is exported both by rail and river to Calcutta. The
manufactures of less importance are tussore-silk, paper, blankets,
brass utensils, firearms, carpets, coarse cutlery and hardware,
leather, ornaments of gold and silver, &amp;c. Of minerals&mdash;lead,
silver and copper exist in the Bhagalpur division, but the mines
are not worked. One coal-mine is worked in the parganas.
Before the construction of railways in India, the Ganges and the
Grand Trunk road afforded the sole means of communication
from Calcutta to the North-Western Provinces. But now the
railroad is the great highway which connects Upper India with
Lower Bengal. The East Indian railway runs throughout the
length of the province. The climate of Behar is very hot from
the middle of March to the end of June, when the rains set in,
which continue till the end of September. The cold season, from
October to the first half of March, is the pleasantest time of the
year.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The province of Behar corresponds to the ancient
kingdom of Magadha, which comprised the country now included
in the districts of Patna, Gaya and Shahabad, south of the
Ganges. The origin of this kingdom, famous alike in the political
and religious history of India, is lost in the mists of antiquity;
and though the Brahmanical <i>Puranas</i> give lists of its rulers
extending back to remote ages before the Christian era, the first
authentic dynasty is that of the Saisunaga, founded by Sisunaga
(<i>c.</i> 600 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), whose capital was at Rajagaha (Rajgir) in the hills
near Gaya; and the first king of this dynasty of whom anything
is known was Bimbisara (<i>c.</i> 528 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), who by conquests and
matrimonial alliances laid the foundations of the greatness of the
kingdom. It was in the reign of Bimbisara that Vardhamana
Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, and Gautama, the founder of
Buddhism, preached in Magadha, and Buddhist missionaries
issued thence to the conversion of China, Ceylon, Tibet and
Tatary. Even to this day Behar, where there are extensive
remains of Buddhist buildings, remains a sacred spot in the
eyes of the Chinese and other Buddhist nations.</p>

<p>Bimbisara was murdered by his son Ajatasatru, who succeeded
him, and whose bloodthirsty policy reduced the whole country
between the Himalayas and the Ganges under the suzerainty of
Magadha. According to tradition, it was his grandson, Udaya,
who founded the city of Pataliputra (Patna) on the Ganges,
which under the Maurya dynasty became the capital not only of
Magadha but of India. The remaining history of the dynasty is
obscure; according to Mr Vincent Smith, its last representative
was Mahanandin (417 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), after whose death the throne was
usurped, under obscure circumstances, by Mahapadma Nanda,
a man of low caste (<i>Early Hist. of India</i>, p. 36). It was a son
of this usurper who was reigning at the time of the invasion
of Alexander the Great; and the conqueror, when his advance
was arrested at the Hyphasis (326 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), meditating an attack on
Pataliputra (the Palimbothra of the Greeks), was informed that
the king of Magadha could oppose him with a force of 20,000
cavalry, 200,000 infantry, 2000 chariots, and 3000 or 4000
elephants. The Nanda dynasty seems to have survived only for
two generations, when (321 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) Chandragupta Maurya, the
founder of the great Maurya dynasty, seized the throne. This
dynasty, of which the history belongs to that of India (<i>q.v.</i>),
occupied the throne for 137 years. After the death of the great
Buddhist king, Asoka (<i>c.</i> 231), the Maurya empire began to break
up, and it was finally destroyed about fifty years later when
Pushyamitra Sunga murdered the Maurya king Brihadratha
and founded the Sunga dynasty. Descendants of Asoka continued,
however, to subsist in Magadha as subordinate rajas for
many centuries; and as late as the 8th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> petty
Maurya dynasties are mentioned as ruling in Konkan. The
reign of Pushyamitra, who held his own against Menander and
succeeded in establishing his claim to be lord paramount of
northern India, is mainly remarkable as marking the beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page655" id="page655"></a>655</span>
of the Brahmanical reaction and the decline of Buddhism;
according to certain Buddhist writers the king, besides reviving
Hindu rites, indulged in a savage persecution of the monks.
The Sunga dynasty, which lasted 112 years, was succeeded by
the Kanva dynasty, which after 45 years was overthrown
(<i>c.</i> 27 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) by the Andhras or Satavahanas. In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 236 the
Andhras were overthrown, and, after a confused and obscure
period of about a century, Chandragupta I. established his power
at Pataliputra (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 320) and founded the famous Gupta empire
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gupta</a></span>), which survived till it was overthrown by the
Ephthalites (<i>q.v.</i>), or White Huns, at the close of the 5th century.
In Magadha itself the Guptas continued to rule as tributary
princes for some centuries longer. About the middle of the 8th
century Magadha was conquered by Gopala, who had made
himself master in Bengal, and founded the imperial dynasty
known as the Palas of Bengal. They were zealous Buddhists,
and under their rule Magadha became once more an active centre
of Buddhist influence. Gopala himself built a great monastery
at Udandapura, or Otantapuri, which has been identified by
Sir Alexander Cunningham with the city of Behar, where the
later Pala kings established their capital. Under Mahipala
(<i>c.</i> 1026), the ninth of his line, and his successor Nayapala,
missionaries from Magadha succeeded in firmly re-establishing
Buddhism in Tibet.</p>

<p>In the 11th century the Pala empire, which, according to the
Tibetan historian Taranath, extended in the 9th century from
the Bay of Bengal to Delhi and Jalandhar (Jullundur) in the
north and the Vindhyan range in the south, was partly dismembered
by the rise of the &ldquo;Sena&rdquo; dynasty in Bengal; and
at the close of the 12th century both Palas and Senas were swept
away by the Mahommedan conquerors, the city of Behar itself
being captured by the Turki free-lance Mahommed-i-Bakhtyar
Khilji in 1193, by surprise, with a party of 200 horsemen. &ldquo;It
was discovered,&rdquo; says a contemporary Arab historian, &ldquo;that the
whole of that fortress and city was a college, and in the Hindi
tongue they call a college Bihar.&rdquo; Most of the monks were
massacred in the first heat of the assault; those who survived
fled to Tibet, Nepal and the south. Buddhism in Magadha
never recovered from this blow; it lingered in obscurity for a
while and then vanished.</p>

<p>Behar now came under the rule of the Mahommedan governors
of Bengal. About 1330 the southern part was annexed to
Delhi, while north Behar remained for some time longer subject
to Bengal. In 1397 the whole of Behar became part of the
kingdom of Jaunpur; but a hundred years later it was annexed
by the Delhi emperors, by whom&mdash;save for a short period&mdash;it
continued to be held. The capital of the province was established
under the Moguls at the city of Behar, which gave its name to
the province. From the middle of the 14th to the middle of the
16th century a large part of Behar was ruled by a line of Brahman
tributary kings; and in the 15th century another Hindu dynasty
ruled in Champaran and Gorakhpur. Behar came into the
possession of the East India Company with the acquisition of the
Diwani in 1765, when the province was united with Bengal. In
1857 two zemindars, Umar Singh and Kumar Singh, rebelled
against the British government, and for some months held the
ruinous fort of Rohtas against the British.</p>

was born in Mosul and early became famous for his knowledge
of the Koran and of jurisprudence. Before the age of thirty he
became teacher in the great college at Bagdad known as the
Niz&#257;miyya, and soon after became professor at Mosul. In 1187, after
making the pilgrimage to Mecca, he visited Damascus. Saladin,
who was at the time besieging Kaukab (a few miles south of
Tiberias), sent for him and became his friend. Beh&#257; ud-D&#299;n
observed that the whole soul of the monarch was engrossed by the
war which he was then engaged in waging against the enemies of
the faith, and saw that the only mode of acquiring his favour
was by urging him to its vigorous prosecution. With this view
he composed a treatise on <i>The Laws and Discipline of Sacred
War</i>, which he presented to Saladin, who received it with peculiar
favour. From this time he remained constantly attached to the
person of the sultan, and was employed on various embassies
and in departments of the civil government. He was appointed
judge of the army and judge of Jerusalem. After Saladin&rsquo;s death
Beh&#257;-ud-Din remained the friend of his son Malik uz-Z&#257;hir,
who appointed him judge of Aleppo. Here he employed some of
his wealth in the foundation of colleges. When Malik uz-Z&#257;hir
died, his son Malik ul-&lsquo;Aziz was a minor, and Beh&#257; ud-D&#299;n had
the chief power in the regency. This power he used largely for the
patronage of learning. After the abdication of Malik ul-&lsquo;Aziz,
he fell from favour and lived in retirement until his death in
1234. Beh&#257; ud-D&#299;n&rsquo;s chief work is his <i>Life of Saladin</i>
(published at Leiden with Latin translation by A. Schultens in
1732 and 1755). An English translation was published by the Palestine
Pilgrims&rsquo; Text Society, London, 1897.</p>

pleasantly situated in the midst of a highly cultivated plain,
128 m. W.N.W. of Shiraz and 3 m. from the left bank of the river
Tab, here called Kurdistan river. It is the capital of the
Kuhgilu-Behbahan sub-province of Fars and has a population of about
10,000. The walls are about 3 m. in circumference and a Narinj
Kalah (citadel) stands in the south-east corner. At a short

capital of the province.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEHEADING,<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> a mode of executing capital punishment (<i>q.v.</i>).
It was in use among the Greeks and Romans, and the former, as
Xenophon says at the end of the second book of the <i>Anabasis</i>,
regarded it as a most honourable form of death. So did the
Romans, by whom it was known as <i>decollatio</i> or <i>capitis
amputatio</i>. The head was laid on a block placed in a pit dug
for the purpose,&mdash;in the case of a military offender, outside
the intrenchments, in civil cases outside the city walls, near the <i>porta decumana</i>.
Before execution the criminal was tied to a stake and whipped
with rods. In earlier years an axe was used; afterwards a sword,
which was considered a more honourable instrument of death,
and was used in the case of citizens (<i>Dig.</i> 48, 19, 28). It was
with a sword that Cicero&rsquo;s head was struck off by a common
soldier. The beheading of John the Baptist proves that the
tetrarch Herod had adopted from his suzerain the Roman mode
of execution. Suetonius (<i>Calig. c</i>. 32) states that
Caligula kept a soldier, an artist in beheading, who in his
presence decapitated prisoners fetched indiscriminately for
that purpose from the gaols.</p>

<p>Beheading is said to have been introduced into England from
Normandy by William the Conqueror. The first person to suffer
was Waltheof, earl of Northumberland, in 1076. An ancient
MS. relating to the earls of Chester states that the serjeants or
bailiffs of the earls had power to behead any malefactor or thief,
and gives an account of the presenting of several heads of felons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page656" id="page656"></a>656</span>
at the castle of Chester by the earl&rsquo;s serjeant. It appears that
the custom also attached to the barony of Malpas. In a roll of
3 Edward II., beheading is called the &ldquo;custom of Cheshire&rdquo;
(Lysons&rsquo; <i>Cheshire</i>, p. 299, from Harl. MS. 2009 fol. 34<i>b</i>). The
liberty of Hardwick, in Yorkshire, was granted the privilege
of beheading thieves. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Guillotine</a></span>.)</p>

<p>But with the exceptions above stated beheading was usually
reserved as the mode of executing offenders of high rank. From
the 15th century onward the victims of the axe include some of
the highest personages in the kingdom: Archbishop Scrope
(1405); duke of Buckingham (1483); Catherine Howard (1542);
earl of Surrey (1547); duke of Somerset (1552); duke of
Northumberland (1553); Lady Jane Grey (1554), Lord Guildford
Dudley (1554); Mary queen of Scots (1587); earl of Essex
(1601); Sir Walter Raleigh (1618); earl of Strafford (1641);
Charles I. (1649); Lord William Russell (1683); duke of
Monmouth (1685); earl of Derwentwater (1716); earl of
Kenmure (1716); earl of Kilmarnock and Lord Balmerino
(1746); and the list closes with Simon, Lord Lovat, who (9th of
April 1747) was the last person beheaded in England. The
execution of Anne Boleyn was carried out not with the axe,
but with a sword, and by a French headsman specially brought
over from Calais. In 1644 Archbishop Laud was condemned
to be hanged, and the only favour granted him, and that reluctantly,
was that his sentence should be changed to beheading.
In the case of the 4th Earl Ferrers (1760) his petition to be
beheaded was refused and he was hanged.</p>

<p>Executions by beheading usually took place on Tower Hill,
London, where the scaffold stood permanently during the 15th
and 16th centuries. In the case of certain state prisoners, <i>e.g.</i>
Anne Boleyn and Lady Jane Grey, the sentence was carried
out within the Tower on the green by St Peter&rsquo;s chapel.</p>

<p>Beheading was only a part of the common-law method of
punishing male traitors, which was ferocious in the extreme.
According to Walcot&rsquo;s case (1696), 1 <i>Eng. Rep.</i> 89, the proper
sentence was &ldquo;quod ... ibidem super bigam (herdillum)
ponatur et abinde usque ad furcas de [Tyburn] trahatur, et
ibidem per collum suspendatur et vivus ad terram prosternatur
et quod secreta membra ejus amputentur, et interiora sua intra
ventrem suum capiantur et in ignem ponantur et ibidem <i>ipso
vivente</i> comburantur, et quod caput ejus amputetur, quodque
corpus ejus in quatuor partes dividatur et illo ponantur ubi
dominus rex eas assignare voluit.&rdquo; There is a tradition that
Harrison the regicide after being disembowelled rose and boxed
the ears of the executioner.</p>

<p>In Townley&rsquo;s case (18 Howell, <i>State Trials</i>, 350, 351) there is a
ghastly account of the mode of executing the sentence; and in
that case the executioner cut the traitor&rsquo;s throat. In the case
of the Cato Street conspiracy (1820, 33 Howell, <i>State Trials</i>, 1566),
after the traitors had been hanged as directed by the act of 1814,
their heads were cut off by a man in a mask whose dexterity led
to the belief that he was a surgeon.</p>

<p>Female traitors were until 1790 liable to be drawn to execution
and burnt alive. In that year hanging was substituted for
burning.</p>

<p>In 1814 so much of the sentence as related to disembowelling
and burning the bowels was abolished and the king was empowered
by royal warrant to substitute decapitation for hanging, which
was made by that act the ordinary mode of executing traitors.
But it was not till 1870 that the portions of the sentence as to
drawing and quartering were abolished (Forfeiture Act 1870).</p>

<p>The more barbarous features of the execution were remitted
in the case of traitors of high rank, and the offender was simply
decapitated.</p>

<p>The block usually employed is believed to have been a low
one such as would be used for beheading a corpse. C.H. Firth
and S.R. Gardiner incline to the view that such a block was the
one used at Charles I.&rsquo;s execution. The more general custom,
however, seems to have been to have a high block over which
the victim knelt. Such is the form of that preserved in the
armoury of the Tower of London. This is undoubtedly the
block upon which Lord Lovat suffered, but, in spite of several
axe-cuts on it, probably not one in early use. The axe which
stands beside it was used to behead him and the other Jacobite
lords, but no certainty exists as to its having been previously
employed. On the ground floor of the King&rsquo;s House, at the
Tower, is preserved the processional axe which figured in the
journeys of state prisoners to and from their trials, the edge
turned from them as they went, but almost invariably turned
towards them as they returned to the Tower. The axe&rsquo;s head
is peculiar in form, 1 ft. 8 in. high by 10 in. wide, and is fastened
into a wooden handle 5 ft. 4 in. long. The handle is ornamented
by four rows of burnished brass nails.</p>

<p>In Scotland they did not behead with the axe, nor with the
sword, as under the Roman law, and formerly in Holland and
France, but with the maiden (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>Capital punishment is executed by beheading in France, and
in Belgium by means of the guillotine.</p>

<p>In Germany the instrument used varies in different states:
in the old provinces of Prussia the axe, in Saxony and Rhenish
Prussia the guillotine. Until 1851 executions were public.
They now take place within a prison in the presence of certain
specified officials.</p>

<p>Beheading is also the mode of executing capital punishment
in Denmark and Sweden. The axe is used. In Sweden the
execution takes place on the order of the king within a prison
in the presence of certain specified officials and, if desired, of
twelve representatives of the commune within which the prison
is situate (Code 1864, s. 2, Royal Ordinance 1877).</p>

<p>In the Chinese empire decapitation is the usual mode of
execution. By an imperial edict (24th of April 1905) certain
attendant barbarities have been suppressed: viz. slicing, cutting
up the body, and exhibiting the head to public view
(32 Clunet, 1175).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEHEMOTH<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> (the intensive plural of the Hebrew <i>b&rsquo;hemah</i>, a
beast), the animal mentioned in the book of Job (ch. xl. 15),
probably the hippopotamus, which in ancient times was found in
Egypt below the cataracts of Syene. The word may be used in
Job as typical of the primeval king of land animals, as leviathan
of the water animals. The modern use expresses the idea of a
very large and strong animal.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEHISTUN,<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Bisitun</span>, now pronounced <i>Bisutum</i>, a little
village at the foot of a precipitous rock, 1700 ft. high, in the
centre of the Zagros range in Persia on the right bank of the
Samas-Ab, the principal tributary of the Kerkha (Choaspes).
The original form of the name, Bagistana, &ldquo;place of the gods&rdquo;
or &ldquo;of God&rdquo; has been preserved by the Greek authors Stephanus
of Byzantium, and Diodorus (ii. 13), the latter of whom says
that the place was sacred to Zeus, <i>i.e.</i> Ahuramazda (Ormuzd).
At its foot passes the great road which leads from Babylonia
(Bagdad) to the highlands of Media (Ecbatana, Hamadan). On
the steep face of the rock, some 500 ft. above the plain, Darius I.,
king of Persia, had engraved a great cuneiform inscription
(11 or 12 ft. high), which recounts the way in which, after the
death of Cambyses, he killed the usurper Gaumata (in Justin
Gometes, the pseudo-Smerdis), defeated the numerous rebels,
and restored the kingdom of the Achaemenidae. Above the
inscription the picture of the king himself is graven, with a bow
in his hand, putting his left foot on the body of Gaumata. Nine
rebel chiefs are led before him, their hands bound behind them,
and a rope round their necks: the ninth is Skunka, the chief of
the Scythians (Sacae) whom he defeated. Behind the king stand
his bow-bearer and his lance-bearer; in the air appears the
figure of the great god Ahuramazda, whose protection led him
to victory.<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The inscriptions are composed in the three languages
which are written with cuneiform signs, and were used in all
official inscriptions of the Achaemenian kings: the chief place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page657" id="page657"></a>657</span>
is of course given to the Persian language (in four columns);
the three Susian (Elamitic) columns lie to the left, and the
Babylonian text is on a slanting boulder above them; a part of
the Babylonian has been destroyed by a torrent, which has made
its way over it. In former times the second language has often
been called Scythian, Turanian or Median; but we now know
from numerous inscriptions of Susa that it is the language of
Elam which was spoken in Susa, the capital of the Persian
empire.</p>

<p>In 1835 the difficult and almost inaccessible cliff was first
climbed by Sir Henry Rawlinson, who copied and deciphered
the inscriptions (1835-1845), and thus completed the reading
of the old cuneiform text and laid the foundation of the science
of Assyriology. Diodorus ii. 13 (cf. xvii. 110), probably following
a later author who wrote the history of Alexander&rsquo;s campaigns,
mentions the sculptures and inscriptions, but attributes them to
Semiramis. At the foot of the rock are the remainders of some
other sculptures (quite destroyed), the fragments of a Greek
inscription of the Parthian prince Gotarzes (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 40; text in
Dittenberger, <i>Orientis graeci inscr. selectae</i>, no. 431), and of an
Arabic inscription.</p>

A description of the locality, with comments on the present state of the
inscriptions and doubtful passages of the Persian text, was given by

Dr Jackson in 1903 climbed to the ledge of the rock and was able to
collate the lower part of the four large Persian columns; he thus
convinced himself that Foy&rsquo;s conjecture of <i>&#257;r&#353;t&#257;m</i> (&ldquo;righteousness&rdquo;)

investigation was carried out in 1904 on the instructions of the
British Museum Trustees by Messrs. L.W. King and R.C. Thompson, who published
their results in 1907 under the title, <i>The Inscription of Darius
the Great at Behistûn</i>, including a full illustrated account of the
sculptures and the inscription, and a complete collation of the text.</p>

British dramatist and novelist, was baptized at Wye,
Kent, in 1640. Her father, John Johnson, was a barber. While
still a child she was taken out to Surinam, then an English
possession, from which she returned to England in 1658, when it
was handed over to the Dutch. In Surinam Aphra learned the
history, and acquired a personal knowledge of the African prince
Oroonoko and his beloved Imoinda, whose adventures she has
related in her novel, <i>Oroonoko</i>. On her return she married Mr
Behn, a London merchant of Dutch extraction. The wit and
abilities of Mrs Behn brought her into high estimation at court,
and&mdash;her husband having died by this time&mdash;Charles II. employed
her on secret service in the Netherlands during the Dutch
war. At Antwerp she successfully accomplished the objects of
her mission; and in the latter end of 1666 she wormed out of
one Van der Aalbert the design formed by De Ruyter, in conjunction
with the DeWitts, of sailing up the Thames and burning
the English ships in their harbours. This she communicated to
the English court, but although the event proved her intelligence
to have been well founded, it was at the time disregarded.
Disgusted with political service, she returned to England, and
from this period she appears to have supported herself by her
writings. Among her numerous plays are <i>The Forced Marriage,
or the Jealous Bridegroom</i> (1671); <i>The Amorous Prince</i> (1671);
<i>The Town Fop</i> (1677); and <i>The Rover, or the Banished Cavalier</i>
(in two parts, 1677 and 1681); and <i>The Roundheads</i> (1682).
The coarseness that disfigures her plays was the fault of her time;
she possessed great ingenuity, and showed an admirable comprehension
of stage business, while her wit and vivacity were unfailing.
Of her short tales, or novelettes, the best is the story of
<i>Oroonoko</i>, which was made the basis of Thomas Southerne&rsquo;s
popular tragedy. Mrs Behn died on the 16th of April 1689, and
was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEHR, WILLIAM JOSEPH<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> (1775-1851), German publicist and
writer, was born at Salzheim on the 26th of August 1775. He
studied law at Würzburg and Göttingen, became professor of
public law in the university of Würzburg in 1799, and in 1819
was sent as a deputy to the <i>Landtag</i> of Bavaria. Having
associated himself with the party of reform, he was regarded with
suspicion by the Bavarian king Maximilian I. and the court
party, although favoured for a time by Maximilian&rsquo;s son, the
future King Louis I. In 1821 he was compelled to give up his
professorship, but he continued to agitate for reform, and in
1831 the king refused to recognize his election to the <i>Landtag</i>.
A speech delivered by Behr in 1832 was regarded as seditious,
and he was arrested. In spite of his assertion of loyalty to the
principle of monarchy he was detained in custody, and in 1836
was found guilty of seeking to injure the king. He then admitted
his offence; but he was not released from prison until 1839, and
the next nine years of his life were passed under police supervision
at Passau and Regensburg. In 1848 he obtained a free
pardon and a sum of money as compensation, and was sent to
the German national assembly which met at Frankfort in May of
that year. He passed his remaining days at Bamberg, where
he died on the 1st of August 1851. Behr&rsquo;s chief writings are:

Nation</i> (Aschaffenburg, 1816); <i>Die Verfassung und Verwaltung

<p><span class="bold">BEIRA,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> a seaport of Portuguese East Africa, at the mouth of
the Pungwe river, in 19° 50&prime; S., 34° 50&prime; E., 488 m. N. of Delagoa
Bay, in communication by railway with Cape Town via Umtali,
Salisbury and Bulawayo. Pop. about 4000, of whom a third
are Europeans, and some 300 Indians. The town is built on a
tongue of sand extending into the river, and is comparatively
healthy. The sea front is protected by a masonry wall, and
there are over 13,000 ft. of wharfage. Vessels drawing 24 ft.
can enter the port at high tide. Between the customs house and
the railway terminus is the mouth of a small river, the Chiveve,
crossed by a steel bridge, the centre span revolving and giving
two passages each of 40 ft. The town is without any architectural
pretensions, but possesses fine public gardens. It is the headquarters
of the Companhai de Moçambique, which administers
the Beira district under charter from the Portuguese crown.
The business community is largely British.</p>

<p>Beira occupies the site of a forgotten Arab settlement. The
present port sprang into being as the result of a clause in the
Anglo-Portuguese agreement of 1891 providing for the construction
of a railway between Rhodesia and the navigable waters of
the Pungwe. The railway at first began at Fontesvilla, about
50 m. by river above Beira, but was subsequently brought down
to Beira. The completion in 1902 of the line connecting Salisbury
with Cape Town adversely affected the port of Beira, the long
railway route from the Cape being increasingly employed by
travellers to and from Mashonaland. Moreover, the high freights
on goods by the Beira route enabled Port Elizabeth to compete
successfully for the trade of Rhodesia. In October 1905 a
considerable reduction was made in railway rates and in port
dues and customs, with the object of re-attracting to the port
the transit trade of the interior, and in 1907 a branch of the
Rhodesian customs was opened in the town. In that year goods
valued at £647,000 passed through the port to Rhodesia. Efforts
were also made to develop the agricultural and mineral resources
of the Beira district itself. The principal exports are rubber,
sugar, ground-nuts and oil seeds, beeswax, chromite (from
Rhodesia), and gold (from Manica). The imports are chiefly
rice (from India) and cotton goods for local use, and food stuffs,
machinery, hardware and manufactured goods for Rhodesia.
For the three years, 1905-1907, the average annual value of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page658" id="page658"></a>658</span>
imports and exports, excluding the transit trade with Rhodesia,
was, imports £200,000, exports £90,000. Direct steamship communication
with Europe is maintained by German and British
lines.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEIRA,<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> an ancient principality and province of northern and
central Portugal; bounded on the N. by Entre Minho e Douro
and by Traz os Montes, E. by the Spanish provinces of Leon
and Estremadura, S. by Alemtejo and Portuguese Estremadura,
and W. by the Atlantic Ocean. Pop. (1900) 1,515,834; area,
9208 sq. m. Beira is administratively divided into the districts
of Aveiro, Coimbra, Vizeu, Guarda and Castello Branco, while
it is popularly regarded as consisting of the three sections&mdash;
Beira Alta or Upper Beira (Vizeu), north and west of the Serra
da Estrella; Beira Baixa or Lower Beira (Guarda and Castello
Branco), south and east of that range; and Beira Mar or Maritime
Beira (Aveiro and Coimbra), coinciding with the former
coastal province of Douro. The coast line, about 72 m. long, is
uniformly flat, with long stretches of sandy pine forest, heath
or marshland bordered by a wide and fertile plain. Its most
conspicuous features are the lagoon of Aveiro (<i>q.v.</i>) and the bold
headland of Cape Mondego; in the south Aveiro, Murtosa, Ovar
and Figueira da Foz are small seaports. Except along the coast,
the surface is for the most part mountainous,&mdash;the highest point
in the Serra da Estrella, which extends from north-east to
south-west through the centre of the province, being 6532 ft.
The northern and south-eastern frontiers are respectively marked
by the two great rivers Douro and Tagus, which rise in Spain
and flow to the Atlantic. The Agueda and Côa, tributaries
of the Douro, drain the eastern plateaus of Beira; the Vouga
rises in the Serra da Lapa, and forms the lagoon of Aveiro at its
mouth; the Mondego springs from the Serra da Estrella, passes
through Coimbra, and enters the sea at Figueira da Foz; and
the Zezere, a tributary of the Tagus, rises north-north-east
of Covilhã and flows south-west and south.</p>

<p>Beira has a warm and equable climate, except in the mountains,
where the snowfall is often heavy. The soil, except in the valleys,
is dry and rocky, and large stretches are covered with heath.
The principal agricultural products are maize, wheat, garden
vegetables and fruit. The olive is largely cultivated, the oil
forming one of the chief articles of export; good wine is also
produced. In the flat country between Coimbra and Aveiro
the marshy land is laid out in rice-fields or in pastures for herds of
cattle and horses. Sheep farming is an important industry in
the highlands of Upper Beira; while near Lamego swine are
reared in considerable numbers, and furnish the well-known
Lisbon hams. Iron, lead, copper, coal and marble are worked
to a small extent, and millstones are quarried in some places.
Salt is obtained in considerable quantities from the lagoons along
the coast. There are few manufactures except the production
of woollen cloth, which occupies a large part of the population
in the district of Castello Branco. Three important lines of
railway, the Salamanca-Oporto, Salamanca-Lisbon and Lisbon-Oporto,
traverse parts of Beira; the two last named are also
connected by the Guarda-Figueira da Foz railway, which has a
short branch line going northwards to Vizeu. The chief towns,
Aveiro (pop. 1900, 9979), Castello Branco (7288), Coimbra
(18,144), Covilhã (15,469), Figueira da Foz (6221), Guarda (6124),
Ilhavo (12,617), Lamego (9471), Murtosa (9737), Ovar (10,462)
and Vizeu (8057), with the frontier fortress of Almeida (2330),
are described in separate articles. There is a striking difference
of character between the inhabitants of the highlands, who are
grave and reserved, hardy and industrious, and those of the
lowlands, who are more sociable and courteous, but less energetic.
The heir-apparent to the throne of Portugal has the title of prince
of Beira.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEIRUT<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Beyrout</span>. (1) A vilayet of Syria, constituted
as recently as 1888, which stretches along the sea-coast from
Jebel el-Akra, south of the Orontes, to the Nahr Zerka, south of
Mount Carmel, and towards the south extends from the Mediterranean
to the Jordan. It includes five <i>sanjaks</i>, Latakia,
Tripoli, Beirut, Acre and Buka&rsquo;a. (2) The chief town of the
vilayet (anc. <i>Berytus</i>), the most important seaport town in
Syria, situated on the south side of St George&rsquo;s Bay, on rising
ground at the foot of Lebanon. Pop. 120,000 (Moslems, 36,000;
Christians, 77,000; Jews, 2500; Druses, 400; foreigners, 4100).
Berytus, whether it is to be identified with Hebrew <i>Berothai</i>
or not (2 Sam. viii. 8; Ezek. xlvii. 16), was one of the most
ancient settlements on the Phoenician coast; but nothing more
than the name is known of it till <span class="scs">B.C.</span> 140, when the town
was taken and destroyed by Tryphon in his contest with
Antiochus VII. for the throne of the Seleucids. It duly passed
under Rome, was much favoured by the Herods and became
a <i>colonia</i>. It was famous for its schools, especially that of law,
from the 4th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> onwards. Justinian recognized it
as one of the three official law schools of the empire (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 533),
but within a few years, as the result of a disastrous earthquake
(551), the students were transferred to Sidon. In the following
century it passed to the Arabs (635), and was not again a Christian
city till 1111, when Baldwin captured it. Saladin retook it
in 1187, and thenceforward, for six centuries and a half, whoever
its nominal lords may have been, Saracen, Crusader, Mameluke
or (from the 16th century) Turk, the Druse emirs of Lebanon
dominated it (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Druses</a></span>). One of these, Fakr ed-Din Maan II.,
fortified it early in the 17th century; but the Turks asserted
themselves in 1763 and occupied the place. During the succeeding
epoch of rebellion at Acre under Jezzar and Abdullah pashas,
Beirut declined to a small town of about 10,000 souls, in dispute
between the Druses, the Turks and the pashas,&mdash;a state of things
which lasted till Ibrahim Pasha captured Acre in 1832. When
the powers moved against the Egyptians in 1840, Beirut had
recently been occupied in force by Ibrahim as a menace to the
Druses; but he was easily driven out after a destructive bombardment
by Admiral Sir Robert Stopford (1768-1847). Since the
pacification of the Lebanon after the massacre of the Christians
in 1860 (for later history, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lebanon</a></span>), Beirut has greatly
increased in extent, and has become the centre of the transit
trade for all southern Syria. In 1894 a harbour, constructed
by a French company, was opened, but the insecurity of the
outer roadstead militates against its success. Nevertheless
trade is on the increase. In 1895 a French company completed
a railway across the Lebanon to Damascus, and connected it
with Mezerib in the Hauran, whence now starts the line to the
Hejaz. Since 1907 it has also had railway communication with
Aleppo; and a narrow-gauge line runs up the coast to Tripoli.
The steepness of the Lebanon railway, and the break of gauge at
Rayak, the junction for Aleppo, have prevented the diversion
of much of the trade of North Syria to Beirut. The town has
been supplied with water, since 1875, by an English company,
and with gas, since 1888, by a French company. There are many
American and European institutions in the city: the American
Presbyterian mission, with a girls&rsquo; school and a printing office,
which published the Arabic translation of the Bible, and now
issues a weekly paper and standard works in Arabic; the Syrian
Protestant college with its theological seminary, medical faculty,
training college and astronomical observatory; the Scottish
mission, and St George&rsquo;s institute for Moslem and Druse girls;
the British Syrian mission schools; the German hospital,
orphanage and boarding school; the French hospital and
schools, and the Jesuit &ldquo;Université de St Joseph&rdquo; with a
printing office. In summer most of the richer residents reside
on the Lebanon, and in winter the governor of the Lebanon and
many Lebanon notables inhabit houses in Beirut. The town
has many fine houses, but the streets are unpaved and the
bazaars mean. The Moslem inhabitants, being in a minority,
have often shown themselves fanatical and turbulent. There
are several fairly good hotels for tourists.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEIT, ALFRED<a name="ar49" id="ar49"></a></span> (1853-1906), British South African financier,
was the son of a well-to-do merchant of Hamburg, Germany,
and in 1875, after a commercial education at home, was sent
out to Kimberley, South Africa, to investigate the diamond
prospects. He had relatives, the Lipperts, out there in business,
and in conjunction with Mr (afterwards Sir) Julius Wernher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page659" id="page659"></a>659</span>
(b. 1850) he rapidly acquired a leading position on the diamond
fields, and became closely allied with the ideals of Cecil Rhodes
(<i>q.v.</i>). In 1889 Rhodes and Beit effected the amalgamation of
various interests in the De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited. It
was largely owing to the capital and enterprise of Beit that the
deep-level mining in the Witwatersrand district of the Transvaal
was started, and he had a large share in the principal company,
the Rand Mines Limited. The firm of Wernher, Beit &amp; Co.
gradually transferred the centre of their financial operations to
London, where they became the leading house in the dealings
in South African mines. The rapid progress made in developing
the diamond and gold output made Beit a man of enormous
wealth, and he utilized it lavishly in pursuit of Rhodes&rsquo;s South
African policy. He was one of the original directors of the
British South Africa company, and was included with Rhodes
in the censure passed by the House of Commons Commission of
Inquiry on the Jameson Raid (1896). He was subsequently one
of Rhodes&rsquo;s trustees. Personally of a modest, gentle, generous
and retiring disposition, and strongly imbued with Rhodes&rsquo;s
ideas of British imperialism, he was one of the South African
millionaires of German birth against whom the anti-imperialist
section in England were never tired of employing their sarcastic
invective. But though shrinking from ostentation in any form,
his purse was continually opened for public objects, notably his
support of the Imperial Light Horse and Imperial Yeomanry in
the South African War of 1899-1902, and his endowment of the
professorship of colonial history at Oxford (1905). He gave
£100,000 to establish a university in his native city of Hamburg
and £200,000 for a university in Johannesburg. He built a fine
house in Park Lane, London, but was never prominent in social
life. He died, unmarried, on the 16th of July 1906.</p>

Herodotus, &ldquo;tallest and finest of men&rdquo; (iii. 17). It has been
suggested, though on insufficient grounds, that the Beja, rather
than the Abyssinians, are the &ldquo;Ethiopians&rdquo; of Herodotus, the
civilized people who built the city of Meroë and its pyramids.
During the Roman period the Beja were much what they are
to-day, nomadic and aggressive, and were constantly at war.
In 216 <span class="scs">A.H.</span> (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 832) the Moslem governor of Assuan made a
treaty with the Beja chief, by which the latter undertook to
guard the road to Aidhab and pay an annual tribute of one
hundred camels. This is the earliest record of a government
engagement with the northern section of the Beja, now the
Ab&#257;bda. Ibn Batuta, early in the 14th century, mentions a
king of Beja, El Hadrabi, who received two-thirds of the revenue
of Aidhab, the other third going to the king of Egypt. The Beja
territory contained gold and emerald mines. The tribesmen
were the usual escort for pilgrims to Mecca from Kus to Aidhab.
According to Leo Africanus, at the close of the 14th or very
early in the 15th century their rich town of Zibid (Aidhab?)
on the Red Sea was destroyed. This seems to have broken up
the tribal cohesion. Leo Africanus describes the Beja as &ldquo;most
base, miserable and living only on milk and camels&rsquo; flesh.&rdquo; In
the middle ages the Beja, partially at any rate, were Christians.
The kingdom of Meroö was succeeded by that of &ldquo;Aloa,&rdquo; the
capital of which, Soba, was on the Blue Nile, about 13 m. above
Khartum. The country was conquered by the Funj (<i>q.v.</i>), a
negroid people who subsequently became Mahommedan and
compelled the Beja to adopt that religion. Until the invasion
of the Egyptians, under Ismail, son of Mehemet Ali (1820), the
Funj remained in possession.</p>

<p>All the Beja are now Mahommedans, but generally only so in
name, though some of the tribes enthusiastically fought for
Mahdiism (1883-99). As a race the Beja are remarkable for
physical beauty, with a colour more red than black, and of a
distinctly Caucasic type of face. The chiefs are, as a rule, of much
fairer complexion than the tribesmen. In spite of their claim to
Arab origin, the tribes have preserved many negro customs in
the matter of costume and scarring the body. Their hair-dressing
is very characteristic. The hair, worn thick as a protection
against the sun, is parted in a circle round the head on a level
with the eyes, above which the hair, saturated with mutton fat
or butter, is trained straight up like a mop, with separate tufts
at sides and back. Most of the tribes are nomadic shepherds,
driving their cattle from pasture to pasture; some few are
occupied in agriculture.</p>

<p>They are polygynous, but, unlike the Arabs, great independence
is granted their women. Among most of the Beja peoples
the wife can return to her mother&rsquo;s tent whenever she likes, and
after a birth of a child she can repudiate the husband, who must
make a present to be re-accepted. Cases are said to have occurred
where the woman has thus obtained all her husband&rsquo;s possessions.
The whole social position of the Beja women points, indeed, to
an earlier matriarchal system. Among some of the tribes the
custom of the &ldquo;fourth day free&rdquo; is observed, by which the
women are only considered married for so many days a week,
forming what liaisons they please on the odd day. The chief
Beja tribes are the Ab&#257;bda, Bish&#257;rïn, Hadendoa, Beni-Amer,
Amarar, Shukuria, Hallenga and Hamran.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEJA<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> (probably the ancient <i>Pax Julia</i>), the capital of an
administrative district formerly included in the province of
Alemtejo, Portugal; situated 95 m. S.S.E. of Lisbon by
the Lisbon-Faro railway, and at the head of a branch line
to Pias e Orada (3855), 26 m. E. Pop. (1900) 8885. Beja is
an episcopal city, built on an isolated hill, and partly enclosed
by walls of Roman origin; on the south it has a fine Roman
gateway. Its cathedral is modern, but the citadel, with its
beautiful Gothic tower of white marble, was founded by King
Diniz (1279-1325). The city is surrounded by far-reaching
plains, known as the Campo de Beja, and devoted partly to the
cultivation of grain and fruit, partly to the breeding of cattle
and pigs; copper, iron and manganese are also mined to a
small extent, and Beja is the central market for all these products.
Cloth, pottery and olive oil are manufactured in the city.</p>

<p>The administrative district of Beja, the largest and most
thinly-populated district in Portugal, coincides with the southern
part of Alemtejo (<i>q.v.</i>); pop. (1900) 163,612; area, 3958 sq. m.;
41.3 inhabitants per sq. m.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEJAN<a name="ar52" id="ar52"></a></span> (Fr. <i>béjaune</i>, from <i>bec jaune</i>, &ldquo;yellow beak,&rdquo; in allusion
to unfledged birds; the equivalent to Ger. <i>Gelbschnabel</i>, Fr.
<i>blanc-bec</i>, a greenhorn), a term for freshmen, or undergraduates
of the first year, in the Scottish universities. The phrase was
introduced from the French universities, where the levying of
<i>bejaunium</i> &ldquo;footing-money&rdquo; had been prohibited by the statutes
of the university of Orleans in 1365 and by those of Toulouse in
1401. In 1493 the election of an <i>Abbas Bejanorum</i> (Abbot of the
Freshmen) was forbidden in the university of Paris. In the
German and Austrian universities the freshman was called <i>beanus</i>.
In Germany the freshman was anciently called a <i>Pennal</i> (from
Med. Lat. <i>pennale</i>, a box for pens), in allusion to the fact that the
newly-arrived student had to carry such for the older pupils.
Afterwards <i>Fuchs</i> (fox) was substituted for <i>Pennal</i>, and then
<i>Goldfuchs</i> because he is supposed still to have a few gold coins
from home.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BÉJART,<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> the name of several French actors, children of
Marie Hérve and Joseph Béjart (d. 1643), the holder of a small
government post. The family&mdash;there were eleven children&mdash;
was very poor and lived in the Marais, then the theatrical
quarter of Paris. One of the sons, <span class="sc">Joseph Béjart</span> (<i>c.</i> 1617-1659),
was a strolling player and later a member of Molière&rsquo;s first
company (l&rsquo;Illustre Théâtre), accompanied him in his theatrical
wanderings, and was with him when he returned permanently
to Paris, dying soon after. He created the parts of Lélie in
<i>L&rsquo;Étourdie</i>, and Eraste in <i>Le Dépit amoureux</i>. His brother Louis
BÉJART (<i>c.</i> 1630-1678) was also in Molière&rsquo;s company during
the last years of its travels. He created many parts in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page660" id="page660"></a>660</span>
brother-in-law&rsquo;s plays&mdash;Valère in <i>Le Dépit amoureux</i>, Dubois in
<i>Le Misanthrope</i>, Alcantor in <i>Le Mariage forcé</i>, and Don Luis in
<i>Le Festin de Pierre</i>&mdash;and was an actor of varied talents. In
consequence of a wound received when interfering in a street
brawl, he became lame and retired with a pension&mdash;the first
ever granted by the company to a comedian&mdash;in 1670.</p>

<p>The more famous members of the family were two sisters.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Madeleine Béjart</span> (1618-1672) was at the head of the travelling
company to which her sister Geneviève (1631-1675)&mdash;who
played as Mlle Hervé&mdash;and her brothers belonged, before
they joined Molière in forming l&rsquo;Illustre Théâtre (1643). With
Molière she remained until her death on the 17th of February
1672. She had had an illegitimate daughter (1638) by an
Italian count, and her conduct on her early travels had not
been exemplary, but whatever her private relations with Molière
may have been, however acrimonious and violent her temper,
she and her family remained faithful to his fortunes. She was
a tall, handsome blonde, and an excellent actress, particularly
in soubrette parts, a number of which Molière wrote for her.
Among her creations were Marotte in <i>Les Précieuses ridicules</i>,
Lisette in <i>L&rsquo;École des maris</i>, Dorine in <i>Tartuffe</i>.</p>

<p>Her sister, <span class="sc">Armande Grésinde Claire Elizabeth Béjart</span>
(1645-1700), seems first to have joined the company at Lyons in
1653. Molière directed her education and she grew up under his
eye. In 1662, he being then forty and she seventeen, they were
married. Neither was happy; the wife was a flirt, the husband
jealous. On the strength of a scurrilous anonymous pamphlet,
<i>La Fameuse Comédienne, ou histoire de la Guérin</i> (1688), her
character has been held perhaps unduly low. She was certainly
guilty of indifference and ingratitude, possibly of infidelity;
they separated after the birth of a daughter in 1665 and met only
at the theatre until 1671. But the charm and grace which fascinated
others, Molière too could not resist, and they were reconciled.
Her portrait is given in a well-known scene (Act iii., sc. 9)
in <i>Le Bourgeois gentilhomme</i>. Mme Molière&rsquo;s first appearance
on the stage was in 1663, as Élise in the <i>Critique de l&rsquo;école des
femmes</i>. She was out of the cast for a short time in 1664, when
she bore Molière a son&mdash;Louis XIV. and Henrietta of England
standing sponsors. But in the spring, beginning with the fêtes
given at Versailles by the king to Anne of Austria and Maria
Theresa, she started her long list of important roles. She was at
her best as Celimène&mdash;really her own highly-finished portrait&mdash;in
<i>Le Misanthrope</i>, and hardly less admirable as Angélique in
<i>Le Malade imaginaire</i>. She was the Elmire at the first performance
of <i>Tartuffe</i>, and the Lucile of <i>Le Bourgeois gentilhomme</i>.
All these parts were written by her husband to display her talents
to the best advantage and she made the most of her opportunities.
The death of Molière, the secession of Baron and several other
actors, the rivalry of the Hôtel de Bourgogne and the development
of the Palais Royal, by royal patent, into the home of
French opera, brought matters to a crisis with the <i>comédiens du
roi</i>. Well advised by La Grange (Charles Varlet, 1639-1692),
Armande leased the Théâtre Guénégaud, and by royal ordinance
the residue of her company were combined with the players from
the Théâtre du Marais, the fortunes of which were at low ebb.
The combination, known as the <i>troupe du roi</i>, at first was
unfortunate, but in 1679 they secured Mlle du Champmeslé, later
absorbed the company of the Hôtel de Bourgogne, and in 1680
the Comédie Française was born. Mme Molière in 1677 had
married Eustache François Guérin (1636-1728), an actor, and
by him she had one son (1678-1708). She continued her successes
at the theatre until she retired in 1694, and she died on the 30th
of November 1700.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEK, ANTONY<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> (d. 1311), bishop of Durham, belonged to a
Lincolnshire family, and, having entered the church, received
several benefices and soon attracted the attention of Edward I.,
who secured his election as bishop of Durham in 1283. When,
after the death of King Alexander III. in 1285, Edward interfered
in the affairs of Scotland, he employed Bek on this business, and
in 1294 he sent him on a diplomatic errand to the German king,
Adolph of Nassau. Taking part in Edward&rsquo;s campaigns in
Scotland, the bishop received the surrender of John de Baliol at
Brechin in 1296, and led one division of the English army at the
battle of Falkirk in 1298. Soon after his return to England he
became involved in a quarrel with Richard de Hoton, prior of
Durham. Deposed and excommunicated by Bek, the prior
secured the king&rsquo;s support; but the bishop, against whom other
complaints were preferred, refused to give way, and by his
obstinacy incurred the lasting enmity of Edward. In 1302, in
obedience to the command of Pope Boniface VIII., he visited
Rome on this matter, and during his absence the king seized and
administered his lands, which, however, he recovered when he
returned and submitted to Edward. He continued, however,
to pursue Richard with unrelenting hostility, and was in his turn
seriously harassed by the king. Having been restored to the
royal favour by Edward II. who made him lord of the Isle of Man,
the bishop died at Eltham on the 3rd of March 1311. A man of
great courage and energy, chaste and generous, Bek was remarkable
for his haughtiness and ostentation. Both as a bishop and
as a private individual he was very wealthy, and his household
and retinue were among the most magnificent in the land. He
was a soldier and a hunter rather than a bishop, and built castles
at Eltham and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Bek&rsquo;s elder brother, <span class="sc">Thomas Bek</span> (d. 1293), bishop of St
David&rsquo;s, was a trusted servant of Edward I. He obtained many
important and wealthy ecclesiastical positions, was made
treasurer of England in 1279, and became bishop of St David&rsquo;s
in 1280. He was a benefactor to his diocese and died on the
12th of May 1293.</p>

<p>Another <span class="sc">Thomas Bek</span> (1282-1347), who was bishop of Lincoln
from 1341 until his death on the 2nd of February 1347, was a
member of the same family.</p>

<p>Antony Bek must not be confused with his kinsman and namesake,
<span class="sc">Antony Bek</span> (1279-1343), who was chancellor and dean
of Lincoln cathedral, and became bishop of Norwich after a
disputed election in 1337. He was a quarrelsome man, and after
a stormy episcopate, died on the 19th of December 1343.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEKE, CHARLES TILSTONE<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> (1800-1874), English traveller,
geographer and Biblical critic, was born in Stepney, Middlesex,
on the 10th of October 1800. His father was a merchant in
London, and Beke engaged for a few years in mercantile pursuits.
He afterwards studied law at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, and for a time
practised at the bar, but finally devoted himself to the study
of historical, geographical and ethnographical subjects. The
first-fruits of his researches appeared in his work entitled <i>Origines
Biblicae, or Researches in Primeval History</i>, published in 1834.
An attempt to reconstruct the early history of the human race
from geological data, it raised a storm of opposition on the part
of defenders of the traditional readings of the book of Genesis;
but in recognition of the value of the work the university of
Tübingen conferred upon him the degree of Ph.D. For about
two years (1837-1838) Beke held the post of acting British consul
in Saxony. From that time till his death his attention was
largely given to geographical studies, chiefly of the Nile valley.
Aided by private friends, he visited Abyssinia in connexion with
the mission to Shoa sent by the Indian government under the
leadership of Major (afterwards Sir) William Cornwallis Harris,
and explored Gojam and more southern regions up to that time
unknown to Europeans. Among other achievements, Beke
was the first to determine, with any approach to scientific
accuracy, the course of the Abai (Blue Nile). The valuable
results of this journey, which occupied him from 1840 to 1843,
he gave to the world in a number of papers in scientific publications,
chiefly in the <i>Journal</i> of the Royal Geographical Society.
On his return to London, Beke re-engaged in commerce, but
devoted all his leisure to geographical and kindred studies. In
1848 he planned an expedition from the mainland opposite
Zanzibar to discover the sources of the Nile. A start was made,
but the expedition accomplished little. Beke&rsquo;s belief that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page661" id="page661"></a>661</span>
White Nile was the main stream was, however, shown to be
accurate by subsequent exploration. In 1856 he endeavoured,
unsuccessfully, to establish commercial relations with Abyssinia
through Massawa. In 1861-1862 he and his wife travelled in
Syria and Palestine, and went to Egypt with the object of
promoting trade with Central Africa and the growth of cotton in
the Sudan.  In 1865 he again went to Abyssinia, for the purpose
of obtaining from King Theodore the release of the British
captives. On learning that the captives had been released, Beke
turned back, but Theodore afterwards re-arrested the party. To
the military expedition sent to effect their release Beke furnished
much valuable information, and his various services to the
government and to geographical research were acknowledged by the
award of £500 in 1868 by the secretary for India, and by the
grant of a civil list pension of £100 in 1870. In his seventy-fourth
year he undertook a journey to Egypt for the purpose of
determining the real position of Mount Sinai. He conceived that
it was on the eastern side of the Gulf of Akaba, and his
journey convinced him that his view was right. It has not,
however, commended itself to general acceptance. Beke died at
Bromley, in Kent, on the 31st of July 1874.</p>

<p>Beke&rsquo;s writings are very numerous. Among the more important,
besides those already named, are:
<i>An Essay on the Nile and its Tributaries</i> (1847),
<i>The Sources of the Nile</i> (1860),
and <i>The British Captives in Abyssinia</i> (1865). He was a fellow
of the Royal Geographical Society, and for his contributions to
the knowledge of Abyssinia received its gold medal, and also
that of the Geographical Society of France. As a result of a
controversy over the statements of another Abyssinian explorer,
Antoine Abbadie, Beke returned the medal awarded him by the
French Society.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEKKER, AUGUST IMMANUEL<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> (1785-1871), German
philologist and critic, was born on the 21st of May 1785. He
completed his classical education at the university of Halle
under F.A. Wolf, who considered him as his most promising
pupil. In 1810 he was appointed professor of philosophy in the
university of Berlin.  For several years, between 1810 and 1821,
he travelled in France, Italy, England and parts of Germany,
examining classical manuscripts and gathering materials for his
great editorial labours. He died at Berlin on the 7th of June
1871. Some detached fruits of his researches were given in the
<i>Anecdota Graeca</i>, 1814-1821; but the full result of his
unwearied industry and ability is to be found in the enormous
array of classical authors edited by him. Anything like a complete
list of his works would occupy too much space, but it may be said
that his industry extended to nearly the whole of Greek literature
with the exception of the tragedians and lyric poets.  His best
known editions are: Plato (1816-1823), Oratores Attici (1823-1824),
Aristotle (1831-1836), Aristophanes (1829), and twenty-five
volumes of the Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae. The only
Latin authors edited by him were Livy (1829-1830) and Tacitus
(1831). Bekker confined himself entirely to textual recension
and criticism, in which he relied solely upon the MSS., and
contributed little to the extension of general scholarship.</p>

Friesland in 1634, and educated at Groningen, under Jacob
Alting, and at Franeker. He was pastor at Franeker, and from
1679, at Amsterdam. An enthusiastic disciple of Descartes, he
wrote several works in philosophy and theology, which by their
freedom of thought aroused considerable hostility. His best
known work <i>Die Betooverde Wereld</i> (1691), or <i>The World
Bewitched</i> (1695; one volume of an English translation from a
French copy), in which he examined critically the phenomena
generally ascribed to spiritual agency, and attacked the belief
in sorcery and &ldquo;possession&rdquo; by the devil, whose very existence
he questioned. The book is interesting as an early study in
comparative religion, but its publication in 1692 led to
Bekker&rsquo;s deposition from the ministry. He died at Amsterdam.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEKKER<a name="ar57b" id="ar57b"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Wolff</span>), <b>ELIZABETH</b> (1738-1804), Dutch
novelist, was married to Adrian Wolff, a Reformed clergyman,

her husband in 1777, she resided for some time in France, with
her close friend, Agatha Deken. She was exposed to some of the
dangers of the French Revolution, and, it is said, escaped the
guillotine only by her great presence of mind. In 1795 she
returned to Holland, and resided at the Hague till her death.
Her novels were written in conjunction with Agatha Deken, and it
is somewhat difficult to determine the exact qualities
contributed by each. The <i>Historie van William Levend</i> (1785),
<i>Historie van Sara Burgerhart</i> (1790), <i>Abraham Blankaart</i> (1787),

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BEL<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span>, the name of a chief deity in Babylonian religion, the
counterpart of the Phoenician Baal (<i>q.v.</i>) ideographically written
as En-lil. Since Bel signifies the &ldquo;lord&rdquo; or &ldquo;master&rdquo; <i>par
excellence</i>, it is, therefore, a title rather than a genuine name,
and must have been given to a deity who had acquired a position
at the head of a pantheon. The real name is accordingly to be
sought in En-lil, of which the first element again has the force
of &ldquo;lord&rdquo; and the second presumably &ldquo;might,&rdquo; &ldquo;power,&rdquo; and the
like, though this cannot be regarded as certain. En-lil is
associated with the ancient city of Nippur, and since En-lil
with the determinative for &ldquo;land&rdquo; or &ldquo;district&rdquo; is a common
method of writing the name of the city, it follows, apart from
other evidence, that En-lil was originally the patron deity of
Nippur. At a very early period&mdash;prior to 3000 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>&mdash;Nippur had
become the centre of a political district of considerable extent,
and it is to this early period that the designation of En-lil as
Bel or &ldquo;the lord&rdquo; reverts. Inscriptions found at Nippur, where
extensive excavations were carried on during 1888-1900 by
Messrs Peters and Haynes, under the auspices of the University
of Pennsylvania, show that Bel of Nippur was in fact regarded
as the head of an extensive pantheon. Among the titles accorded
to him are &ldquo;king of lands,&rdquo; &ldquo;king of heaven and earth&rdquo; and
&ldquo;father of the gods.&rdquo; His chief temple at Nippur was known
as E-Kur, signifying &ldquo;mountain house,&rdquo; and such was the
sanctity acquired by this edifice that Babylonian and Assyrian
rulers, down to the latest days, vied with one another in
embellishing and restoring Bel&rsquo;s seat of worship, and the name
itself became the designation of a temple in general. Grouped
around the main sanctuary there arose temples and chapels to
the gods and goddesses who formed his court, so that E-Kur
became the name for an entire sacred precinct in the city of
Nippur. The name &ldquo;mountain house&rdquo; suggests a lofty structure and
was perhaps the designation originally of the staged tower at
Nippur, built in imitation of a mountain, with the sacred shrine
of the god on the top. The tower, however, also had its special
designation of &ldquo;Im-Khar-sag,&rdquo; the elements of which, signifying
&ldquo;storm&rdquo; and &ldquo;mountain,&rdquo; confirm the conclusion drawn from other
evidence that En-lil was originally a storm-god having his seat
on the top of a mountain. Since the Euphrates valley has no
mountains, En-lil would appear to be a god whose worship was
carried into Babylonia by a wave of migration from a
mountainous country&mdash;in all probability from Elam to the east.</p>

<p>When, with the political rise of Babylon as the centre of a
great empire, Nippur yielded its prerogatives to the city over
which Marduk presided, the attributes and the titles of En-lil
were transferred to Marduk, who becomes the &ldquo;lord&rdquo; or Bel of
later days. The older Bel did not, however, entirely lose his
standing. Nippur continued to be a sacred city after it ceased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page662" id="page662"></a>662</span>
to have any considerable political importance, while in addition
the rise of the doctrine of a triad of gods symbolizing the three
divisions&mdash;heavens, earth and water&mdash;assured to Bel, to whom
the earth was assigned as his province, his place in the religious
system. The disassociation from his local origin involved in
this doctrine of the triad gave to Bel a rank independent of
political changes, and we, accordingly, find Bel as a factor in the
religion of Babylonia and Assyria to the latest days. It was
no doubt owing to his position as the second figure of the triad
that enabled him to survive the political eclipse of Nippur and

<p><span class="bold">BELA III<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span>. (d. 1196), king of Hungary, was the second son of
King Géza II. Educated at the Byzantine court, where he had
been compelled to seek refuge, he was fortunate enough to win
the friendship of the brilliant emperor Manuel who, before the
birth of his own son Alexius, intended to make Bela his successor
and betrothed him to his daughter. Subsequently, however,
he married the handsome and promising youth to Agnes of
Châtilion, duchess of Antioch, and in 1173 placed him, by force
of arms, on the Hungarian throne, first expelling Bela&rsquo;s younger
brother Géza, who was supported by the Catholic party. Initiated
from childhood in all the arts of diplomacy at what was then the
focus of civilization, and as much a warrior by nature as his
imperial kinsman Manuel, Bela showed himself from the first
fully equal to all the difficulties of his peculiar position. He began
by adopting Catholicism and boldly seeking the assistance of
Rome. He then made what had hitherto been an elective a
hereditary throne by crowning his infant son Emerich his
successor. In the beginning of his reign he adopted a prudent
policy of amity with his two most powerful neighbours, the
emperors of the East and West, but the death of Manuel in 1180
gave Hungary once more a free hand in the affairs of the Balkan
Peninsula, her natural sphere of influence. The attempt to
recover Dalmatia, which involved Bela in two bloody wars with
Venice (1181-88 and 1190-91), was only partially successful.
But he assisted the Rascians or Serbs (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hungary</a></span>: <i>History</i>)
to throw off the Greek yoke and establish a native dynasty, and
attempted to made Galicia an appanage of his younger son
Andrew. It was in Bela&rsquo;s reign that the emperor Frederick I.,
in the spring of 1189, traversed Hungary with 100,000 crusaders,
on which occasion the country was so well policed that no harm
was done to it and the inhabitants profited largely from their
commerce with the German host. In his last years Bela assisted
the Greek emperor Isaac II. Angelus against the Bulgarians.
His first wife bore Bela two sons, Emerich and Andrew. On her
death he married Margaret of France, sister of King Philip
Augustus. Bela was in every sense of the word a great statesman,
and his court was accounted one of the most brilliant in Europe.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BELA IV<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span>. (1206-1270), king of Hungary, was the son of
Andrew II., whom he succeeded in 1235. During his father&rsquo;s
lifetime he had greatly distinguished himself by his administration
of Transylvania, then a wilderness, which, with incredible
patience and energy, he colonized and christianized. He repaired
as far as possible the ruinous effects of his father&rsquo;s wastefulness,
but on his accession found everything in the utmost confusion,
&ldquo;the great lords,&rdquo; to cite the old chronicler Rogerius (<i>c</i>. 1223-1266),
&ldquo;having so greatly enriched themselves that the king
was brought to naught.&rdquo; The whole land was full of violence,
the very bishops storming rich monasteries at the head of armed
retainers. Bela resolutely put down all disorder. He increased
the dignity of the crown by introducing a stricter court etiquette,
and its wealth by recovering those of the royal domains which
the magnates had appropriated during the troubles of the last
reign. The pope, naturally on the side of order, staunchly
supported this regenerator of the realm, and in his own brother
Coloman, who administered the district of the Drave, Bela also
found a loyal and intelligent co-operator. He also largely
employed Jews and Ishmaelites,<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the financial specialists of the
day, whom he rewarded with lands and titles. The salient event
of Bela&rsquo;s reign was the terrible Tatar invasion which reduced
three-quarters of Hungary to ashes. The terror of their name
had long preceded them, and Bela, in 1235 or 1236, sent the
Dominican monk Julian, by way of Constantinople, to Russia, to
collect information about them from the &ldquo;ancient Magyars&rdquo;
settled there, possibly the Volgan Bulgarians. He returned to
Hungary with the tidings that the Tatars contemplated the
immediate conquest of Europe. Bela did his utmost to place his
kingdom in a state of defence, and appealed betimes to the
pope, the duke of Austria and the emperor for assistance; but
in February and March 1241 the Tatars burst through the
Carpathian passes; in April Bela himself, after a gallant stand,
was routed on the banks of the Sajó and fled to the islands of
Dalmatia; and for the next twelve months the kingdom of
Hungary was merely a geographical expression. The last twenty-eight
years of Bela&rsquo;s reign were mainly devoted to the reconstruction
of his realm, which he accomplished with a single-minded
thoroughness which has covered his name with glory.
(See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hungary</a></span>: <i>History</i>.)</p>

<p>Perhaps the most difficult part of his task was the recovery of
the western portions of the kingdom (which had suffered least)
from the hands of Frederick of Austria, who had seized them as
the price of assistance which had been promised but never given.
First Bela solicited the aid of the pope, but was compelled finally
to resort to arms, and crossing the Leitha on the 15th of June
1246, routed Frederick, who was seriously wounded and trampled
to death by his own horsemen. With him was extinguished the
male line of the house of Babenberg. In the south Bela was less
successful. In 1243 he was obliged to cede to Venice, Zara, a
perpetual apple of discord between the two states; but he
kept his hold upon Spalato and his other Dalmatian possessions,
and his wise policy of religious tolerance in Bosnia enabled
Hungary to rule that province peaceably for many years. The
new Servian kingdom of the Nemanides, on the other hand, gave
him much trouble and was the occasion of many bloody wars.
In 1261 the Tatars under Nogai Khan invaded Hungary for the
second time, but were defeated by Bela and lost 50,000 men.
Bela reached the apogee of his political greatness in 1264 when,
shortly after his crushing defeat of the Servian king, Stephen
Urosh, he entertained at his court, at Kalocsa, the ambassadors
of the newly restored Greek emperor, of the kings of France,
Bulgaria and Bohemia and three Tatar <i>mirzas</i>. For a time
Bela was equally fortunate in the north-west, where the ambitious
and enterprising Pøemyslidae had erected a new Bohemian
empire which absorbed the territories of the old Babenbergers
and was very menacing to Hungary. With Ottakar II. in
particular, Bela was almost constantly at war for the possession
of Styria, which ultimately fell to the Bohemians. The last years
of Bela&rsquo;s life were embittered by the ingratitude of his son
Stephen, who rebelled continuously against his father and
ultimately compelled him to divide the kingdom with him, the
younger prince setting up a capital of his own at Sárospatak, and
following a foreign policy directly contrary to that of his father.
Bela died on the 3rd of May 1270 in his sixty-fourth year. With
the people at large he was popular to the last; his services to
his country had been inestimable. He married, while still
crown-prince, Maria, daughter of the Nicaean emperor, Theodore
Lascaris, whom his own father brought home with him from his
crusade. She bore him, besides his two sons Stephen and Bela,
seven daughters, of whom St Margaret was the most famous.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELA,<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> <span class="sc">Las Bela</span>, or <span class="sc">Lus Beyla</span>, situated in 26° 27&prime; 30&Prime; N.
lat. and 66° 45&prime; 0&Prime; E. long., 350 ft. above sea level, capital of the
small independent state of Las Bela to the south of Kalat
(Baluchistan), ruled by the Jam (or Cham), who occupies the
position of a protected chief under the British Raj. To the east
lies Sind, and to the west Makran, and from time immemorial
the great trading route between Sind and Persia has passed
through Las Bela. The area of Las Bela is 6357 sq. m., and its
population in 1901 was 56,109, of which 54,040 were Mussulmans.
The low-lying, alluvial, hot and malarial plains of Las Bela,
occupying about 6000 sq. m. on the north-east corner of the
Arabian Sea, are highly irrigated and fertile&mdash;two rivers from
the north, the Purali and the Kud, uniting to provide a plentiful
water supply. The bay of Sonmiani once extended over most
of these plains, where the Purali delta is now growing with
measurable strides. The hill ranges to the east, parting the
plains from Sind (generally known locally as the Mor and the
Kirthar), between which lies the long narrow line of the Hab
valley, strike nearly north and south, diminishing in height as
they approach the sea and allowing of a route skirting the coast
between Karachi and Bela. To the west they are broken into
an infinity of minor ridges massing themselves in parallel formation
with a strike which curves from south to west till they
form the coast barrier of Makr&#257;n. The Persian route from
India, curving somewhat to the north, traverses this waste of
barren ridges almost at right angles, but on dropping into the
Kolwah valley its difficulty ceases. It then becomes an open
road to Kej and Persia, with an easy gradient. This was undoubtedly
one of the greatest trade routes of the medieval days
of Arab ascendancy in Sind, and it is to this route that Bela
owes a place in history which its modern appearance and dimensions
hardly seem to justify. Bela is itself rather prettily situated
on a rocky site above the banks of the Purali. About four miles
to the south are the well-kept gardens which surround the tomb
of Sir Robert Sandeman; which is probably destined to become
a &ldquo;ziarat,&rdquo; or place of pilgrimage, of even greater sanctity than
that of General Jacob at Jacobabad. The population of the
town numbers about 5000. The Jam&rsquo;s retinue consists of about
300 infantry, 50 cavalry, and 4 guns. Liability to assist on active
service is the only acknowledgment of the suzerainty which is
paid by the Jam to the Khan of Kalat. The Jam, Mir Kamal
Khan, succeeded his father, Sir Mir Khan, in 1895, and was
formally invested with powers in 1902.</p>

<p>From very early times this remote corner of Baluchistan has
held a distinct place in history. There are traces of ancient Arab
(possibly Himyaritic) occupation to be found in certain stone
ruins at Gondakeha on the Kud river, 10 m. to the north-west of
Bela, whilst the Greek name &ldquo;Arabis&rdquo; for the Purali is itself
indicative of an early prehistoric connexion with races of Asiatic
Ethiopians referred to by Herodotus. On the coast, near the
village of Sonmiani (a station of the Indo-Persian telegraph line)
may be traced the indentation which once formed the bay of
Morontobara, noted in the voyage of Nearchus; and it was on the
borders of Makr&#257;n that the Turanian town of Rhambakia was
situated, which was once the centre of the trade in &ldquo;bdellium.&rdquo;
In the 7th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> Las Bela was governed by a Buddhist
priest, at which time all the province of Gandava was Buddhist,
and Sind was ruled by the Brahman, Chach. Buddhist caves are
to be found excavated in the conglomerate cliffs near Gondakeha,
at a place called Gondrani, or Shahr-i-Rogan. With the influx of
Arabs into Makran, Bela, under the name of Armel (or Armabel),
rose to importance as a link in the great chain of trading towns
between Persia and Sind; and then there existed in the delta such
places as Yusli (near the modern Uthal) and Kambali (which may
possibly be recognized in the ruins at Khairokot), and many
smaller towns, each of which possessed its citadel, its caravanserai
and bazaar, which are not only recorded but actually mapped by
one of the medieval Arab geographers, Ibn Haukal. It is probable
that Karia Pir, 1½ m. to the east of the modern city, represents
the site of the Armabel which was destroyed by Mahommed
Kasim in his victorious march to Sind in 710. There is another
old site 5 m. to the west of the modern town. The ruins at
Karia Pir, like those of Tijarra Pir and Khairokot, contain Arab
pottery, seals, and other medieval relics. The Lumris, or Lasis,
who originate the name Las as a prefix to that of Bela, are the
dominant tribe in the province. They are comparatively recent
arrivals who displaced the earlier Tajik and Brahui occupants.
It is probable that this influx of Rajput population was coincident
with the displacement of the Arab dynasties in Sind by the
Mahommedan Rajputs in the 11th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> Some authorities
connect the Lumris with the Sumras.</p>

William Beechey&rsquo;s expedition to the Pacific and Bering Strait,
as a surveyor. He subsequently commanded a surveying ship
on the north and west coasts of Africa and in the British seas,
and in 1836 took up the work which Beechey left unfinished on
the Pacific coast of South America. This was on board the
&ldquo;Sulphur,&rdquo; which was ordered to return to England in 1839 by
the Trans-Pacific route. Belcher made various observations
at a number of islands which he visited, was delayed by being
despatched to take part in the war in China in 1840-1841, and
reached home only in 1842. In 1843 he was knighted, and was
now engaged in the &ldquo;Samarang,&rdquo; in surveying work in the East
Indies, the Philippines, &amp;c., until 1847. In 1852 he was given
command of the government Arctic expedition in search of Sir
John Franklin. This was unsuccessful; Belcher&rsquo;s inability
to render himself popular with his subordinates was peculiarly
unfortunate in an Arctic voyage, and he was not wholly suited
to command vessels among ice. This was his last active service,
but he became K.C.B. in 1867 and an admiral in 1872. He
published a <i>Treatise on Nautical Surveying</i> (1835), <i>Narrative

<p><span class="bold">BELESME, ROBERT OF<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> (fl. 1100), earl of Shrewsbury.
From his mother Mabel Talvas he inherited the fief of Belesme,
and from his father, the Conqueror&rsquo;s companion, that of Shrewsbury.
Both were march-fiefs, the one guarding Normandy from
Maine, and the other England from the Welsh; consequently
their lord was peculiarly powerful and independent. Robert is
the typical feudal noble of the time, circumspect and politic,
persuasive and eloquent, impetuous and daring in battle, and
an able military engineer; in person, tall and strong; greedy
for land, an oppressor of the weak, a systematic rebel and traitor,
and savagely cruel. He first appears as a supporter of Robert&rsquo;s
rebellion against the Conqueror (1077); then as an accomplice
in the English conspiracy of 1088 against Rufus. Later he served
Rufus in Normandy, and was allowed to succeed his brother Hugh

in the earldom of Shrewsbury (1098). But at the height of his
power, he revolted against Henry I (1102). He was banished
and deprived of his English estate; for sometime after he
remained at large in Normandy, defying the authority of Robert
and Henry alike. He betrayed Robert&rsquo;s cause at Tinchebrai;

<p><span class="bold">BELFAST,<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> a city, county and parliamentary borough, the
capital of the province of Ulster, and county town of county
Antrim, Ireland. Pop. (1901) 349,180. It is a seaport of the
first rank, situated at the entrance of the river Lagan into
Belfast Lough, 112¾ m. north of Dublin by rail, on the north-east
coast of the island. It is an important railway centre, with
terminal stations of the Great Northern, Northern Counties
(Midland of England), and Belfast &amp; County Down railways, and
has regular passenger communication by sea with Liverpool,
Fleetwood, Heysham, Glasgow, and other ports of Great Britain.
It is built on alluvial deposit and reclaimed land, mostly not
exceeding 6 ft. above high water mark, and was thus for a long
period subject to inundation and epidemics, and only careful
drainage rendered the site healthy. The appearance of the city
plainly demonstrates the modern growth of its importance, and
evidence is not wanting that for a considerable period architectural
improvement was unable to keep pace with commercial
development. Many squalid districts, however, have been improved
away to make room for new thoroughfares and handsome
buildings. One thoroughfare thus constructed at the close of
the 19th century is the finest in Belfast&mdash;Royal Avenue. It
contains, among several notable buildings, the post office, and
the free public library, opened in 1888 and comprising a collection
of over 40,000 volumes, as well as an art gallery and a museum
of antiquities especially rich in remains of the Neolithic period.
The architect was Mr W.H. Lynn. The magnificent city hall,
from designs of Mr (afterwards Sir) Brumwell Thomas, was
opened in 1906. The principal streets, such as York Street,
Donegall Street, North Street, High Street, are traversed by
tramways. Four bridges cross the Lagan; the Queen&rsquo;s Bridge
(1844, widened in 1886) is the finest, while the Albert Bridge
(1889) replaces a former one which collapsed. Other principal
public buildings, nearly all to be included in modern schemes of
development, are the city hall, occupying the site of the old
Linen Hall, in Donegall Square, estimated to cost £300,000;
the commercial buildings (1820) in Waring Street, the customhouse
and inland revenue office on Donegall Quay, the architect
of which, as of the court house, was Sir Charles Lanyon, and
some of the numerous banks, especially the Ulster Bank. The
Campbell College in the suburb of Belmont was founded in 1892
in accordance with the will of Mr W.J. Campbell, a Belfast
merchant, who left £200,000 for the building and endowment
of a public school. Other educational establishments are
Queen&rsquo;s University, replacing the old Queen&rsquo;s College (1849) under
the Irish Universities Act 1908; the Presbyterian and the
Methodist Colleges, occupying neighbouring sites close to the
extensive botanical gardens, the Royal Academical Institution,
and the Municipal Technical Institute. In 1897 the sum of
£100,000 was subscribed by citizens to found a hospital (1903) to
commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, and
named after her. It took the place of an institution which, under
various names, had existed since 1797. Public monuments are
few, but include a statue of Queen Victoria (1903) and a South
African War memorial (1905) in front of the city hall; the Albert
Memorial (1870), in the form of a clock-tower, in Queen Street;
a monument to the same prince in High Street; and a statue in
Wellington Place to Dr Henry Cooke, a prominent Presbyterian
minister who died in 1868. The corporation controls the gas
and electric and similar undertakings. The water supply, under
the control of the City and District Water Commissioners (incorporated
1840), has its sources in the Mourne Mountains, Co.
Down, 40 m. distant, with a service reservoir at Knockbreckan;
also in the hilly district near Carrickfergus. There are several
public parks, of which the principal are the Ormeau Park (1870),
the Victoria, Alexandra, and Falls Road parks. There is a
Theatre Royal in Arthur Square. There are also several excellent
clubs and societies, social, political, scientific, and sporting;
including among the last the famous Royal Ulster Yacht
Club.</p>

<p>In 1899 was laid the foundation stone of the Protestant
cathedral in Donegall Street, designed by Sir Thomas Drew
and Mr W.H. Lynn to seat 3000 worshippers, occupying the site
of the old St Anne&rsquo;s parish church, part of the fabric of which
the new building incorporates. The diocese is that of Down,
Connor, and Dromore. The first portion (the nave) was consecrated
on the 2nd of June 1904. The plan is a Latin cross, the
west front rising to a height of 105 ft., while the central tower is
175 ft. The pulpit was formerly used in the nave of Westminster
Abbey, being presented to Belfast cathedral by the dean and
chapter of that foundation.</p>

<p>Most of the older churches are classical in design, and the most
notable are St George&rsquo;s, in High Street, and the Memorial church
of Dr Cooke in May Street. For the more modern churches the
Gothic style has frequently been used. Amongst these are St
James, Antrim Road; St Peter&rsquo;s Roman Catholic chapel, with
its Florentine spire; Presbyterian churches in Fitzroy Avenue,
and Elmwood Avenue, and the Methodist chapel, Carlisle Circus.
The Presbyterians and Protestant Episcopalians each outnumber
the Roman Catholics in Belfast, and these three are the chief
religious divisions.</p>

<p><i>Environs.</i>&mdash;The country surrounding Belfast is agreeable and
picturesque, whether along the shores of the Lough or towards
the girdle of hills to the west; and is well wooded and studded
with country seats and villas. In the immediate vicinity of the
city are several points of historic interest and natural beauty.
The Cave Hill, though exceeded in height by Mount Divis,
Squire&rsquo;s Hill, and other summits, is of greatest interest for its
caves, in the chalk, from which early weapons and other objects
have been recovered. The battle in 1408, which was fought along
the base of the cliffs here between the Savages of the Ards and
the Irish, is described in Sir Samuel Ferguson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hibernian
Nights Entertainment.&rdquo; Here also are McArt&rsquo;s Fort and other
earthworks, and from here the importance of the physical position
of Belfast may be appreciated to the full. At Newtonbreda,
overlooking the Lagan, was the palace of Con O&rsquo;Neill, whose sept
was exterminated by Deputy Mountjoy in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth. Belfast Lough is of great though quiet beauty;
and the city itself is seen at its best from its seaward approach,
with its girdle of hills in the background. On the shores of the
lough several villages have grown into residential towns for the
wealthier classes, whose work lies in the city. Of these Whitehouse
and White Abbey are the principal on the western shore,
and on the eastern, Holywood, which ranks practically as a
suburb of Belfast, and, at the entrance to the lough, Bangor.</p>

<p><i>Harbour and Trade.</i>&mdash;The harbour and docks of Belfast are
managed by a board of harbour commissioners, elected by the
ratepayers and the shipowners. The outer harbour is one of the
safest in the kingdom. By the Belfast Harbour Acts the commissioners
were empowered to borrow more than £2,500,000 in
order to carry out several new works and improvements in the
port. Under the powers of these acts a new channel, called the
Victoria Channel, several miles in length, was cut about 1840
leading in a direct line from the quays to the sea. This channel
affords 20 ft. of water at low tide, and 28 ft. at full tide, the
width of the channel being 300 ft. The Alexandra Dock, which
is 852 ft. long and 31 ft. deep, was opened in 1889, and the
extensive improvements (including the York Dock, where vessels
carrying 10,000 tons can discharge in four to six days) have been
effected from time to time, making the harbour one of the most
commodious in the United Kingdom. The provision of a new
graving dock adjoining the Alexandra was delayed in October
1905 by a subsidence of the ground during its construction.
Parliamentary powers were obtained to construct a graving dock
capable of accommodating the largest class of warships. The
growth and development of the shipbuilding industry has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page665" id="page665"></a>665</span>
immense, the firm of Harland &amp; Wolff being amongst the first
in the trade, and some of the largest vessels in the world come
from their yards. The vast increase of the foreign trade of
Belfast marks its development, like Liverpool, as a great distributing
port. The chief exports are linen, whisky, aerated waters,
iron ore and cattle.</p>

<p>Belfast is the centre of the Irish linen industry, machinery for
which was introduced by T. &amp; A. Mulholland in 1830, a rapid
extension of the industry at once resulting. It is also the headquarters
and business centre for the entire flax-spinning and
weaving industry of the country. Distilling is extensively carried
on. Several firms are engaged in the manufacture of mineral
waters, for which the water of the Cromac Springs is peculiarly
adapted. Belfast also has some of the largest tobacco works
and rope works in the world.</p>

<p><i>Administration.</i>&mdash;In conformity with the passing of the
Municipal Corporations Act of 1840 the constitution of the corporation
was made to consist of ten aldermen and thirty councillors,
under the style and title of &ldquo;The Mayor, Aldermen, and
Burgesses of the Borough of Belfast.&rdquo; In 1888 the rank of a city
was conferred by royal charter upon Belfast, with the incidental
rank, liberties, privileges, and immunities. In 1892 Queen
Victoria conferred upon the mayor of the city the title of lord
mayor, and upon the corporation the name and description of
&ldquo;The Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens of the city of Belfast.&rdquo;
By the passing of the Belfast Corporation Act of 1896, the
boundary of the city was extended, and the corporation made
to consist of fifteen aldermen and forty-five councillors, and the
number of wards was increased from five to fifteen. By virtue
of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, Belfast became a
county borough on the 1st of April 1899. By the Local Government
(Ireland) Act 1898, Belfast became for assize purposes
&ldquo;the county of the city of Belfast,&rdquo; with a high sheriff. It is
divided into four parliamentary divisions north, south, east and
west, each returning one member. The total area is 16,594 acres.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The etymology of the name (for which several
derivations have been proposed) and the origin of the town are
equally uncertain, and there is not a single monument of antiquarian
interest upon which to found a conjecture. About 1177
a castle is said to have been built by John de Courcy, to be
destroyed by Edward Bruce in 1316. It may be noted here that
Belfast Castle was finally burnt in 1708; but a modern mansion,
on Cave Hill, outside the city, bears that name. About the
beginning of the 16th century, Belfast is described as a town
and fortress, but it was in reality a mere fishing village in the
hands of the house of O&rsquo;Neill. In the course of the wars of
Gerald Fitzgerald, 8th earl of Kildare, Belfast was twice attacked
by him, in 1503 and 1512. The O&rsquo;Neills, always opposed to the
English, had forfeited every baronial right; but in 1552 Hugh
O&rsquo;Neill of Clandeboye promised allegiance to the reigning
monarch, and obtained the castle of Carrickfergus, the town
and fortress of Belfast, and all the surrounding lands. Belfast
was then restored from the half ruined state into which it had
fallen, and the castle was garrisoned. The turbulent successors
of O&rsquo;Neill having been routed by the English, the town and
fortress were obtained by grant dated the 16th of November 1571
by Sir Thomas Smith, a favourite of Queen Elizabeth, but were
afterwards forfeited by him to the lord deputy Sir Arthur
Chichester, who, in 1612, was created Baron Chichester of Belfast.
At this time the town consisted of about 120 houses, mostly
built of mud and covered with thatch, while the castle, a two-storeyed
building, was roofed with shingles. A charter was now
granted to the town by James I. (April 27, 1613) constituting
it a corporation with a chief magistrate and 12 burgesses and
commonalty, with the right of sending two members to parliament.
In 1632 Thomas Wentworth, Earl Strafford, was appointed
first lord deputy of Ireland, and Belfast soon shared largely in
the benefits of his enlightened policy, receiving, among other
favours, certain fiscal rights which his lordship had purchased
from the corporation of Carrickfergus. Two years after the
rebellion of 1641 a rampart was raised round the town, pierced
by four gates on the land side. In 1662, as appears by a map
still extant, there were 150 houses within the wall, forming five
streets and as many lanes; and the upland districts around
were one dense forest of giant oaks and sycamores, yielding
an unfailing supply of timber to the woodmen of Carrickfergus.</p>

<p>Throughout the succeeding fifty years the progress of Belfast
surpassed that of most other towns in Ireland. Its merchants
in 1686 owned forty ships, of a total carrying power of 3300 tons,
and the customs collected were close upon £20,000. The old
charter was annulled by James II. and a new one issued in 1688,
but the old was restored in 1690 by William III. When the
king arrived at Belfast in that year there were only two places
of worship in the town, the old corporation church in the High
Street, and the Presbyterian meeting-house in Rosemary Lane,
the Roman Catholics not being permitted to build their chapels
within the walls of corporate towns.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 18th century Belfast had become
known as a place of considerable trade, and was then thought a
handsome, thriving and well-peopled town, with many new
houses and good shops. During the civil commotions which
so long afflicted the country, it suffered less than most other
places; and it soon afterwards attained the rank of the richest
commercial town in the north of Ireland. James Blow and Co.
introduced letterpress printing in 1696, and in 1704 issued the
first copy of the Bible produced in the island. In September
1737, Henry and Robert Joy started the <i>Belfast News Letter</i>.
Twenty years afterwards the town contained 1800 houses and
8549 inhabitants, 556 of whom were members of the Church
of Rome. It was not, however, till 1789 that Belfast obtained
the regular communication, which towns of less importance
already enjoyed, with Dublin by stage coach, a fact which is
to be explained by the badness of the roads and the steepness
of the hills between Newry and Belfast.</p>

<p>The increased freedom of trade with which Ireland was
favoured, the introduction of the cotton manufacture by Robert
Joy and Thomas M&rsquo;Cabe in 1777, the establishment in 1791 of
shipbuilding on an extensive scale by William Ritchie, an
energetic Scotsman, combined with the rope and canvas
manufacture already existing, supplied the inhabitants with
employments and increased the demand for skilled labour.
The population now made rapid strides as well by ordinary
extension as by immigration from the rural districts. Owing
to the close proximity of powerful opposed religious sects,
the modern history of the city is not without its record of riot
and bloodshed, as in 1880 and 1886, and in August 1907 serious
rioting followed upon a strike of carters; but the prosperity of
the city has been happily unaffected.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELFAST,<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> a city, port of entry, and the county-seat of Waldo
county, Maine, U.S.A., on Belfast Bay (an arm of the Penobscot),
and about 32 m. south-south-west of Bangor. Pop. (1890)
5294; (1910) 4618. It is served by the Belfast branch of the
Maine Central railway (connecting with the main line at Burnham
Junction, 33 m. distant), and by the coasting steamers (from
Boston) of the Eastern Steamship Co. The city, a summer
resort, lies on an undulating hillside, which rises from the water&rsquo;s
edge to a height of more than 150 ft., and commands extensive
views of the picturesque islands, headlands, and mountains
of the Maine coast. It has a public library. Among the
industries of Belfast are trade with the surrounding country,
the manufacture of shoes, leather boards, axes, and sashes,
doors and blinds, and the building and repairing of boats.
Its exports in 1908 were valued at $285,913 and its imports
at $10,313. Belfast was first settled (by Scottish-Irish) in
1769, and in 1773 was incorporated as a town under its present
name (from Belfast, Ireland). The town was almost completely
destroyed by the British in 1779, but its rebuilding was begun in
the next year. It was held by a British force for five days in
September 1814. Belfast was chartered as a city in 1850.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELFORT,<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> <span class="sc">Territory of</span>, administrative division of eastern
France, formed from the southern portion of the department
of Haut-Rhin, the rest of which was ceded to Germany by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page666" id="page666"></a>666</span>
treaty of Frankfort (1871). It is bounded on the N.E. and E.
by German Alsace, on the S.E. and S. by Switzerland, on the S.W.
by the department of Doubs, on the W. by that of Haute-Saône,
on the N. by that of Vosges. Pop. (1906), 95,421.</p>

<p>With an area of only 235 sq. m., it is, next to that of Seine,
the smallest department of France. The northern part is
occupied by the southern offshoots of the Vosges, the southern
part by the northern outposts of the Jura. Between these two
highlands stretches the Trouée (depression) de Belfort, 18½ m.
broad, joining the basins of the Rhine and the Rhone, traversed
by the canal from the Rhone to the Rhine and by several railways.
A part of the natural highway open from Frankfort to the
Mediterranean, the Trouée has from earliest times provided
the route for the migration from north to south, and is still of
great commercial and strategical value. The northern part,
occupied by the Vosges, rises to 4126 ft. in the Ballon d&rsquo;Alsace,
the northern termination and the culminating point of the
department; to 3773 ft. in the Planche des Belles-Filles; to
3579 ft. in the Signal des Plaines; to 3534 ft. in the Bärenkopf;
and to numerous other lesser heights. South of the Trouée
de Belfort, there rise near Delle limestone hills, in part wooded,
on the frontiers of France, Alsace, and Switzerland, attaining
1680 ft. in the Forêt de Florimont. The territory between
Lachapelle-sous-Rougemont (in the north-east), Belfort and
Delle does not rise above 1300 ft. The line of lowest altitude
follows the river St Nicolas and the Rhone-Rhine canal. The
chief rivers are the Savoureuse, 24 m. long, running straight
south from the Ballon d&rsquo;Alsace, and emptying into the Allaine;
the Allaine, from Switzerland, entering the territory a little to
the south of Delle, and leaving it a little to the west of Morvillars;
the St Nicolas, 24 m. long, from the Bärenkopf, running southwards
and then south-west into the Allaine. The climate to
the north of the town of Belfort is marked by long and rigorous
winters, sudden changes of temperature, and an annual rainfall
of 31 in. to 39 in. retained by an impervious subsoil; farther
south it is milder and more equable with a rainfall of 23 in. to
31 in., quickly absorbed by the soil or evaporated by the sun.
About one-third of the total area is arable land; wheat, oats and
rye are the chief cereals; potatoes come next in importance.
Forest covers another third of the surface; the chief trees are
firs, pines, oak and beech; cherries are largely grown for the
distillation of kirsch. Pasture and forage crops cover the remaining
third of the Territory; only horned cattle are raised
to any extent. There is an unworked concession of copper,
silver and lead at Giromagny; and there are also quarries of
stone. The Territory is an active industrial region. The two
main branches of manufacture are the spinning and weaving
of cotton and wool, and the production of iron and iron-goods
(wire, railings, nails, files, &amp;c.) and machinery. Belfort has
important locomotive and engineering works. Hoisery is
manufactured at Delle, watches, clocks, agricultural machinery,
petrol motors, ironware and electrical apparatus at the flourishing
centre of Beaucourt, and there are numerous saw-mills, tile and
brick works and breweries. Imports consist of raw materials
for the industries, dyestuffs, coal, wine, &amp;c., and the exports of
manufactured goods.</p>

<p>Belfort is the capital of the Territory, which comprises one
arrondissement, 6 cantons and 106 communes, and falls within
the circumscriptions of the archbishopric, the court of appeal
and the académie (educational division) of Besançon. It forms
the 7th subdivision of the VII. army corps. Both the Eastern
and the Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée railways traverse the Territory,
and the canal from the Rhone to the Rhine accompanies the
river St Nicolas for about 6 m.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BELFORT,<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> a town of eastern France, capital of the Territory
of Belfort, 275 m. E.S.E. of Paris, on the main line of the Eastern
railway. Pop. (1906), town, 27,805; commune, 34,649. It is
situated among wooded hills on the Savoureuse at the intersection
of the roads and railway lines from Paris to Basel and from
Lyons to Mülhausen and Strassburg, by which it maintains
considerable trade with Germany and Switzerland. The town is
divided by the Savoureuse into a new quarter, in which is the
railway station on the right bank, and the old fortified quarter,
with the castle, the public buildings and monuments, on the
left bank. The church of St Denis, a building in the classical
style, erected from 1727 to 1750, and the hôtel de ville (1721-1724)
both stand in the Place d&rsquo;Armes opposite the castle. The
two chief monuments commemorate the defence of Belfort in
the war of 1870-1871. &ldquo;The Lion of Belfort,&rdquo; a colossal figure
78 ft. long and 52 ft. high, the work of F.A. Bartholdi, stands
in front of the castle; and in the Place d&rsquo;Armes is the bronze
group &ldquo;Quand Même&rdquo; by Antonin Mercié, in memory of Thiers
and of Colonel Pierre Marie Aristide Denfert-Rochereau (1823-1878),
commandant of the place during the siege. Other objects
of interest are the Tour de la Miotte, of unknown origin and date,
which stands on the hill of La Miotte to the N.E. of Belfort, and
the Port de Brisach, a gateway built by Vauban in 1687.
Belfort is the seat of a prefect; its public institutions include
tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a chamber of
commerce, a lycée, a training-college and a branch of the Bank
of France. The construction of locomotives and machinery,
carried on by the Société Alsacienne, wire-drawing, and the
spinning and weaving of cotton are included among its industries,
which together with the population increased greatly owing to
the Alsacian immigration after 1871. Its trade is in the wines
of Alsace, brandy and cereals. The town derives its chief
importance from its value as a military position.</p>

<p>After the war of 1870-1871, Belfort, which after a diplomatic
struggle remained in French hands, became a frontier fortress
of the greatest value, and the old works which underwent the
siege of 1870-1871 (see below) were promptly increased and
re-modelled. In front of the Perches redoubts, the Bosmont,
whence the Prussian engineers began their attack, is now heavily
fortified with continuous lines called the <i>Organisation défensive
de Bosmont</i>. The old Bellevue redoubt (now Fort Denfert-Rochereau)
is covered by a new work situated likewise on the
ground occupied by the siege trenches in the war. Pérouse,
hastily entrenched in 1870, now possesses a permanent fort.
The old entrenched camp enclosed by the castle, Fort La Miotte,
and Fort Justice, is still maintained, and part even of the enceinte
built by Vauban is used for defensive purposes. Outside this
improved inner line, which includes the whole area of the attack
and defence of 1870, lies a complete circle of detached forts and
batteries of modern construction. To the north, Forts Salbert
and Roppe form the salients of a long defensive line on high
ground, at the centre of which, where the Savoureuse river
divides it, a new work was added later. Two works near
Giromagny, about 8 m. from Belfort itself, connect the fortress
with the right of the defensive line of the Moselle (Fort Ballon
d&rsquo;Alsace). In the eastern sector of the defences (from Roppe
to the Savoureuse below Belfort) the forts are about 3 m. from
the centre, the works near the Belfort-Mülhausen railway being
somewhat more advanced, and in the western (from Salbert to
Fort Bois d&rsquo;Oyé on the lower Savoureuse) they are advanced to
about the same distance. The fort of Mont Vaudois, the westernmost,
overlooks Héricourt and the battlefield of the Lisaine:
farther to the south Montbéliard is also fortified. The perimeter
of the Belfort defences is nearly 25 m.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Gallo-Roman remains have been discovered in the
vicinity of Belfort, but the place is first heard of in the early
part of the 13th century, when it was in the possession of the counts
of Montbéliard. From them it passed by marriage to the counts
of Ferrette and afterwards to the archdukes of Austria. By
the treaty of Westphalia (1648) the town was ceded to Louis XIV.
who gave it to Cardinal Mazarin.</p>

<p>In the Thirty Years&rsquo; War Belfort was twice besieged, 1633
and 1634, and in 1635 there was a battle here between the duke
of Lorraine and the allied French and Swedes under Marshal
de la Force. The fortifications of Vauban were begun in 1686.
Belfort was besieged in 1814 by the troops of the allies and in
1815 by the Austrians.</p>

<p>The most famous episode of the town&rsquo;s history is its gallant
and successful defence in the war of 1870-1871.</p>

<p>The events which led up to the siege are described under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page667" id="page667"></a>667</span>
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Franco-German War</a></span>. Even before the investment Belfort
was cut off from the interior of France, and the German corps of
von Werder was, throughout the siege, between the fortress and
the forces which might attempt its relief. The siege corps was
commanded by General von Tresckow and numbered at first
10,000 men with twenty-four field guns&mdash;a force which appeared
adequate for the reduction of the antiquated works of Vaubau.
Colonel Denfert-Rochereau was, however, a scientific engineer of
advanced ideas as well as a veteran soldier of the Crimea and
Algeria, and he had been stationed at Belfort for six years.
He was therefore eminently fitted for the command of the
fortress. He had as a nucleus but few regular troops, but the
energy of the military and civil authorities enabled his force to
be augmented by national guards, &amp;c., to 17,600 men. The
artillery was very numerous, but skilled gunners were not
available in any great strength and ammunition was scarce.
Perhaps the most favourable circumstance from a technical
point of view was the bomb-proof accommodation of the enceinte.</p>

<div class="center pt2"><img style="width:523px; height:393px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img667.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="pt2">The old fortress consisted of the town enceinte, the castle
(situated on high ground and fortified by several concentric
envelopes), and the entrenched camp, a hollow enclosed by
continuous lines, the salients of which were the castle, Fort La
Justice and Fort La Miotte. These were planned in the days
of short-range guns, and were therefore in 1870 open to an
overwhelming bombardment by the rifled cannon of the attack.
Denfert-Rochereau, however, understood better than other
engineers of the day the power of modern artillery, and his plan
was to utilize the old works as a keep and an artillery position.
The Perches ridge, whence the town and suburbs could be
bombarded, he fortified with all possible speed. On the right
bank of the Savoureuse he constructed two new forts, Bellevue
in the south-west and Des Barres to the west, and, further,
he prepared the suburb on this side for a hand-to-hand defence.
His general plan was to maintain as advanced a line as possible,
to manoeuvre against the investing troops, and to support his
own by the long range fire of his rifled guns. With this object
he fortified the outlying villages, and when the Germans (chiefly
Landwehr) began the investment on the 3rd of November 1870,
they encountered everywhere a most strenuous resistance.
Throughout the month the garrison made repeated sorties, and
the Germans were on several occasions forced by the long range
fire of the fortress to evacuate villages which they had taken.
Under these circumstances, and also because of their numerical
weakness and the rigour of the weather, the Germans advanced
but slowly. On the 2nd of December, when at last von Tresckow
broke ground for the construction of his batteries, the French
still held Danjoutin, Bosmont, Pérouse and the adjacent woods,
and, to the northward (on this side the siege was not pressed)
La Forge. Thus the first attack of the siege artillery was confined
to the western side of the river between Essert and Bavillers.
From this position the bombardment opened on the 3rd of
December. Some damage was done to the houses of Belfort,
but the garrison was not intimidated, and their artillery replied
with such spirit that after some days the German commander
gave up the bombardment. On this occasion the distant forts
La Miotte and La Justice fired with effect at a range of 4700 yds.,
affording a conspicuous illustration of the changed conditions
of siege-craft. The German batteries, as more guns arrived,
were extended from left to right, and on the 13th of December
the Bosmont was captured, ground being also gained in front of
Bellevue. The difficulties under which the siege corps laboured
were very great, and it was not until the 7th of January 1871
that the rightmost battery opened fire. The formal siege of the
Perches redoubts had now been decided upon, and as an essential
preliminary to further operations, Danjoutin, now isolated, was
stormed by the Landwehr on the night of the 7th-8th January.
In the meanwhile typhus and smallpox had broken out amongst
the French, many of the national guards were impatient of
control, and the German trenches, in spite of difficulties of ground
and weather, made steady progress towards the Perches. A
week after the fall of Danjoutin the victory of von Werder and
the XIV. army corps at the Lisaine, in which a part of the siege
corps bore a share, put an end to the attempt to relieve Belfort,
and the siege corps was promptly increased to a strength of 17,600
infantry, 4700 artillery and 1100 engineers, with thirty-four
field-guns besides the guns and howitzers of the siege train.
The investment was now more strictly maintained even on the
north side. On the night of the 20th of January the French
lines about Pérouse were carried by assault, and, both flanks
being now cleared, the formal siege of the Perches forts was
opened, the first parallel extending from Danjoutin to Haut
Taillis. In the early morning of the 27th a determined but
premature attempt was made to storm the Perches redoubts,
which cost the besiegers nearly 500 men. After this failure
Tresckow once more resorted to the regular method of siege
approaches, and on the 2nd of February the second parallel was
thrown up. La Justice was now bombarded by two new batteries
near Pérouse, the Perches were of course subjected to an &ldquo;artillery
attack,&rdquo; and henceforward the besiegers fired 1500 shells a day
into the works of the French. But the besiegers were still weak
in numbers and their labours were very exhausting. Bellevue
and Des Barres became very active in hindering the advance
of the siege works, and the German battalions were so far depleted
by losses and sickness that they could often muster but 300 men
for duty. Still, the guns of the attack were now steadily gaining
the upper hand, and at last on the 8th of February the Germans
entered the two Perches redoubts. This success, and the arrival
of German reinforcements, decided the siege. The Perches ridge
was crowned with a parallel and numerous batteries, which in
the end mounted ninety-seven guns. The attack on the castle
now opened, but operations were soon afterwards suspended
by the news that Belfort was now included in the general armistice
(February 15th). A little later Denfert-Rochereau received
a direct order from his own government to surrender the fortress,
and the garrison, being granted free withdrawal, marched out
with its arms and trains. &ldquo;The town had suffered terribly ...
nearly all the buildings were damaged ... the guns in the upper
batteries could only be reached by ladders. The garrison, of
its original strength of 17,700 officers and men, had lost 4750,
besides 336 citizens. The place was no longer tenable&rdquo; (Moltke,
<i>Franco-German War</i>). Nevertheless, &ldquo;the defence was by no
means at its last stage&rdquo; at the time of the formal surrender
(British <i>Text-Book of Fortification</i>, 1893). The total loss of the
besiegers was about 2000 men.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELGAE,<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> a Celtic people first mentioned by Caesar, who
states that they formed the third part of Gaul, and were separated
from the Celtae by the Sequana (Seine) and Matrona (Marne).
On the east and north their boundary was the lower Rhine, on
the west the ocean. Whether Caesar means to include the Leuci,
Treviri and Mediomatrici among the Belgian tribes is uncertain.
According to the statement of the deputation from the Remi to
Caesar (<i>Bell. Gall.</i> ii. 4), the Belgae were a people of German
origin, who had crossed the Rhine in early times and driven out
the Galli. But Caesar&rsquo;s own statement (<i>B.G.</i> i. 1) that the
Belgae differed from the Celtae in language, institutions and
laws, is too sweeping (see Strabo iv. p. 176), at least as regards
language, for many words and names are common to both.
In any case, only the eastern districts would have been affected
by invaders from over the Rhine, the chief seat of the Belgae
proper being in the west, the country occupied by the Bellovaci,
Ambiani and Atrebates, to which it is probable (although the
reading is uncertain) that Caesar gives the distinctive name
Belgium (corresponding to the old provinces of Picardy and
Artois). The question is fully discussed by T.R. Holmes
(<i>Caesar&rsquo;s Conquest of Gaul</i>, 1899), who comes to the conclusion
that &ldquo;when the Reman delegates told Caesar that the Belgae
were descended from the Germans, they probably only meant
that the ancestors of the Belgic conquerors had formerly dwelt
in Germany, and this is equally true of the ancestors of the Gauls
who gave their name to the Celtae; but, on the other hand, it is
quite possible that in the veins of some of the Belgae flowed
the blood of genuine German forefathers.&rdquo; W. Ridgeway (<i>Early
Age of Greece, 1901</i>) considers that the Belgic tribes were Cimbri,
&ldquo;who had moved directly across the Rhine into north-eastern
Gaul.&rdquo; No definite number of Belgian tribes is given by Caesar;
according to Strabo (iv. p. 196) they were fifteen in all. The
Belgae had also made their way over to Britain in Caesar&rsquo;s time
(<i>B.G.</i> ii. 4, v. 12), and settled in some of the southern counties
(Wilts, Hants and Somerset). Among their towns were <i>Magnus
Portus</i> (Portsmouth) and <i>Venta Belgarum</i> (Winchester).</p>

<p>In 57 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, after the defeat of Ariovistus, the Belgae formed a
coalition against Caesar, and in 52 took part in the general
rising under Vercingetorix. After their final subjugation,
Caesar combined the territory of the Belgae, Celtae and Aquitani
into a single province (Gallia Comata). Augustus, however,
finding it too unwieldy, again divided it into three provinces,
one of which was Belgica, bounded on the west by the Seine and
the Arar (Saône); on the north by the North Sea; on the east
by the Rhine from its mouth to the Lacus Brigantinus (Lake
Constance). Its southernmost district embraced the west of
Switzerland. The capital and residence of the governor of the
province was Durocortorum Remorum (Reims). Under Diocletian,
Belgica Prima (capital, Augusta Trevirorum, Trier) and
Secunda (capital, Reims) formed part of the &ldquo;diocese&rdquo; of Gaul.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BELGAUM,<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> a town and district of British India, in the southern
division of Bombay. The town is situated nearly 2500 ft. above
sea-level; it has a station on the Southern Mahratta railway,
245 m. S. of Poona. It has an ancient fortress, dating
apparently from 1519, covering about 100 acres, and surrounded
by a ditch; within it are two interesting Jain temples. Belgaum
contains a cantonment which is the headquarters of a brigade
in the 6th division of the western army corps. It is also a
considerable centre of trade and of cotton weaving. There are
cotton mills. Pop. (1901) 36,878.</p>

<p>The district of Belgaum has an area of 4649 sq. m. To the
north and east the country is open and well cultivated, but to
the south it is intersected by spurs of the Sahyadri range, thickly
covered in some places with forest. In 1901 the population was
993,976, showing a decrease of 2% compared with an increase of
17% in the preceding decade. The principal crops are millet,
rice, wheat, other food-grains, pulse, oil-seeds, cotton, sugar-cane,
spices and tobacco. There are considerable manufactures
of cotton-cloth. The town of Gokak is known for its dyes, its
paper and its wooden and earthenware toys. The West Deccan
line of the Southern Mahratta railway runs through the district
from north to south. Two high schools at Belgaum town are
maintained by government and by the London Mission. The
Kurirs, a wandering and thieving tribe, the Kamais, professional
burglars, and the Baruds, cattle-stealers and highwaymen, are
notorious among the criminal classes.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The ancient name of the town of Belgaum was
Venugrama, which is said to be derived from the bamboos that
are characteristic of its neighbourhood. The most ancient
place in the district is Halsi; and this, according to inscriptions
on copper plates discovered in its neighbourhood, was once the
capital of a dynasty of nine Kadamba kings. It appears that
from the middle of the 6th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> to about 760 the country
was held by the Chalukyas, who were succeeded by the Rashtrakutas.
After the break-up of the Rashtrakuta power a portion
of it survived in the Rattas (875-1250), who from 1210 onward
made Venugrama their capital. Inscriptions give evidence of a
long struggle between the Rattas and the Kadambas of Goa,
who succeeded in the latter years of the 12th century in acquiring
and holding part of the district. By 1208, however, the
Kadambas had been overthrown by the Rattas, who in their
turn succumbed to the Yadavas of Devagiri in 1250. After the
overthrow of the Yadavas by the Delhi emperor (1320), Belgaum
was for a short time under the rule of the latter; but only a few
years later the part south of the Ghatprabha was subject to the
Hindu rajas of Vijayanagar. In 1347 the northern part was
conquered by the Bahmani dynasty, which in 1473 took the town
of Belgaum and conquered the southern part also. When
Aurungzeb overthrew the Bijapur sultans in 1686, Belgaum
passed to the Moguls. In 1776 the country was overrun by
Hyder Ali, but was retaken by the Peshwa with British assistance.
In 1818 it was handed over to the East India Company and was
made part of the district of Dharwar. In 1836 this was divided
into two parts, the southern district continuing to be known as
Dharwar, the northern as Belgaum.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELGIUM<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> (Fr. <i>Belgique</i>; Flem. <i>Belgie</i>), an independent,
constitutional and neutral state occupying an important position
in north-west Europe. It was formerly part of the Low Countries
or Netherlands (<i>q.v.</i>). Although the name Belgium only came
into general use with the foundation of the modern kingdom in
1830, its derivation from ancient times is clear and incontrovertible.
Beginning with the Belgae and the Gallia Belgica of
the Romans, the use of the adjective to distinguish the inhabitants
of the south Netherlands can be traced through all stages of
subsequent history. During the Crusades, and in the middle ages,
the term <i>Belgicae principes</i> is of frequent occurrence, and when
in 1790 the Walloons rose against Austria during what was called
the Brabant revolution, their leaders proposed to give the
country the name of Belgique. Again in 1814, on the expulsion
of the French, when there was much talk of founding an independent
state, the same name was suggested for it. It was not
till sixteen years later, on the collapse of the united kingdom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page669" id="page669"></a>669</span>
the Netherlands, that the occasion presented itself for giving
effect to this proposal. For the explanation of the English form
of the name it may be mentioned that Belgium was a canton of
what had been the Nervian country in the time of the Roman
occupation.</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Topography, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Belgium lies between 49° 30&prime; and 51° 30&prime; N.,
and 2° 32&prime; and 6° 7&prime; E., and on the land side is bounded by
Holland on the N. and N.E., by Prussia and the grand duchy of
Luxemburg on the E. and S.E., and by France on the S. Its
land frontiers measure 793 m., divided as follows:&mdash;with Holland
269 m., with Prussia 60 m., with the grand duchy 80 m. and
with France 384 m. In addition it has a sea-coast of 42 m.
The western portion of Belgium, consisting of the two Flanders,
Antwerp and parts of Brabant and Hainaut, is flat, being little
above the level of the sea; and indeed at one point near Furnes
it is 7 ft. below it. The same description applies more or less to
the north-east, but in the south of Hainaut and the greater part
of Brabant the general level of the country is about 300 ft.
above the sea, with altitudes rising to more than 600 ft. South
of the Meuse, and in the district distinguished by the appellation
&ldquo;Between Sambre and Meuse,&rdquo; the level is still greater, and the
whole of the province of Luxemburg is above 500 ft., with altitudes
up to 1650 ft. In the south-eastern part of the province
of Liége there are several points exceeding 2000 ft. The highest
of these is the Baraque de Michel close to the Prussian frontier,
with an altitude of 2190 ft. The Baraque de Fraiture, north-east
of La Roche, is over 2000 ft. While the greater part of western
and northern Belgium is devoid of the picturesque, the Ardennes
and the Fagnes districts of &ldquo;Between Sambre and Meuse&rdquo; and
Liége contain much pleasant and some romantic scenery. The
principal charm of this region is derived from its fine and
extensive woods, of which that called St Hubert is the best known.
There are no lakes in Belgium, but otherwise it is exceedingly
well watered, being traversed by the Meuse for the greater part
of its course, as well as by the Scheldt and the Sambre. The
numerous affluents of these rivers, such as the Lys, Dyle, Dender,
Ourthe, Amblève, Vesdre, Lesse and Semois, provide a system
of waterways almost unique in Europe. The canals of Belgium
are scarcely less numerous or important than those of Holland,
especially in Flanders, where they give a distinctive character
to the country. But the most striking feature in Belgium,
where so much is modern, utilitarian and ugly, is found in the
older cities with their relics of medieval greatness, and their
record of ancient fame. These, in their order of interest, are
Bruges, Antwerp, Louvain, Brussels, Ghent, Ypres, Courtrai,
Tournai, Furnes, Oudenarde and Liége. It is to them rather
than to the sylvan scenes of the Ardennes that travellers and
tourists flock.</p>

<p>The climate may be described as temperate and approximating
to that of southern England, but it is somewhat hotter in summer
and a little colder in winter. In the Ardennes, owing to the
greater elevation, the winters are more severe.</p>

<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;Belgium lies upon the northern side of an ancient
mountain chain which has long been worn down to a low level
and the remnants of which rise to the surface in the Ardennes,
and extend eastward into Germany, forming the Eifel and
Westerwald, the Hunsrück and the Taunus. Westward the
chain lies buried beneath the Mesozoic and Tertiary beds of
Belgium and the north of France, but it reappears in the west of
England and Ireland. It is the &ldquo;Hercynian chain&rdquo; of Marcel
Bertrand, and is composed entirely of Palaeozoic rocks. Upon
its northern margin lie the nearly undisturbed Cretaceous and
Tertiary beds which cover the greater part of Belgium. The
latest beds which are involved in the folds of this mountain
range belong to the Coal Measures, and the final elevation must
have taken place towards the close of the Carboniferous period.
The fact that in Belgium Jurassic beds are found upon the
southern and not upon the northern margin indicates that in
this region the chain was still a ridge in Jurassic times. In the
Ardennes the rocks which constitute the ancient mountain chain
belong chiefly to the Devonian System, but Cambrian beds rise
through the Devonian strata, forming the masses of Rocroi,
Stavelot, &amp;c., which appear to have been islands in the Devonian
sea. The Ordovician and Silurian are absent here, and the
Devonian rests unconformably upon the Cambrian; but along
the northern margin of the Palaeozoic area, Ordovician and
Silurian rocks appear, and beds of similar age are also exposed
farther north where the rivers have cut through the overlying
Tertiary deposits. Carboniferous beds occur in the north of
the Palaeozoic area. Near Dinant they are folded amongst the
Devonian beds, but the most important band runs along the
northern border of the Ardennes. In this band lie the coalfields
of Liége, and of Mons and Charleroi. It is a long and narrow
trough, which is separated from the older rocks of the Ardennes
by a great reversed fault, the <i>faille du midi</i>. In the southern
half of the trough the folding of the Coal Measures is intense;
in the northern half it is much less violent. The structure is
complicated by a thrust-plane which brings a mass of older
beds upon the Coal Measures in the middle of the trough.
Except along the southern border of the Ardennes, and at one or
two points in the middle of the Palaeozoic massif, Triassic and
Jurassic beds are unknown in Belgium, and the Palaeozoic
rocks are directly and unconformably overlaid by Cretaceous
and Tertiary deposits. The Cretaceous beds are not extensive,
but the Wealden deposits of Bernissart, with their numerous
remains of Iguanodon, and the chalk of the district about the
Dutch frontier near Maastricht, with its very late Cretaceous
fauna, are of special interest.</p>

<p>Exclusive of the Ardennes the greater part of Belgium is
covered by Tertiary deposits. The Eocene, consisting chiefly
of sands and marls, occupies the whole of the west of the country.
The Oligocene forms a band stretching from Antwerp to Maastricht,
and this is followed towards the north by a discontinuous
strip of Miocene and a fairly extensive area of Pliocene. The
Tertiary deposits are similar in general character to those of the
north of France and the south of England. Coal and iron are by
far the most important mineral productions of Belgium. Zinc,
lead and copper are also extensively worked in the Palaeozoic
rocks of the Ardennes.</p>

<p><i>Constitution and Government</i>.&mdash;The Belgian constitution,
drafted by the national assembly in 1830-1831 after the provisional
government had announced that &ldquo;the Belgian provinces
detached by force from Holland shall form an independent state,&rdquo;
was published on the 7th of February 1831, and the modifications
introduced into it subsequently, apart from the composition of
the electorate, have been few and unimportant. The constitution
originally contained one hundred and thirty-nine articles,
and decreed in the first place that the government was to be
&ldquo;a constitutional, representative and hereditary monarchy.&rdquo;
Having decided in favour of a monarchy, the provisional government
first offered the throne to the due de Nemours, son of
Louis-Philippe, but this offer was promptly withdrawn on the
discovery that Europe would not endorse it. It was then offered
to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, widower of the princess
Charlotte of England, and accepted by him. The prince was
proclaimed on the 4th of June 1831 as Leopold I., king of the
Belgians, and on the 21st of July 1831 he was solemnly inaugurated
in Brussels. The succession is vested in the heirs male
of Leopold I., and should they ever make complete default the
throne will be declared vacant, and a national assembly composed
of the two chambers elected in double strength will make a fresh
nomination. In 1894 a new article numbered 61 was inserted
in the constitution providing that &ldquo;in default of male heirs the
king can nominate his successor with the assent of the two
chambers, and if no such nomination has been made the throne
shall be vacant,&rdquo; when the original procedure of the constitution
would be followed. The Belgian national assembly assumed
that its constitution would extend over the whole of the Belgic or
south Netherlands, but the powers decreed otherwise. The
limits of Belgium are fixed by the London protocol of the 15th
of October 1831&mdash;also called the twenty-four articles&mdash;which
cut off what is now termed the grand duchy of Luxemburg,
and also a good portion of the duchy of Limburg. These losses
of territory held by a brother people are still felt as a grievance
by many Belgians. The Belgian constitution stipulates for
&ldquo;freedom of conscience, of education, of the press and also of
the right of meeting,&rdquo; but the sovereign must be a member of
the Church of Rome. The government was to consist of the king,
the senate and the chamber of representatives. The functions
of the king are those that appertain everywhere to the sovereign
of a constitutional state. He is the head of the army and has
the exclusive right of dissolving the chambers as preliminary
to an appeal to the country.</p>

<p>The senate is composed of seventy-six elected members and
twenty-six members nominated by the provincial councils.
A senator sits for eight years unless a dissolution is ordered,
and no one is eligible until he is forty years of age. Half the
seventy-six elected senators retire for re-election every four
years. There is no payment or other privilege, except a pass
on the state railways, attached to the rank of senator. The
chamber of representatives contained one hundred and fifty-two
members until 1899, when the number was increased to one
hundred and sixty-six. Deputies are elected for four years, but
half the house is re-elected every two years. A deputy must
be twenty-five years of age, and the members of both houses
must be of Belgian nationality, born or naturalized. A deputy
receives an annual honorarium of 4000 francs and a railway
pass. Down to 1893 the electorate was exceedingly small.
Property and other qualifications kept the voting power in the
hands of a limited class. This may be judged from the fact
that in the year named there were only 137,772 voters out of a
population of 65 millions. In April 1894 the new electoral law
altered the whole system. The property qualification was
removed and every Belgian was given one vote on attaining
twenty-five years of age and after one year&rsquo;s residence in his
commune. At the same time the principle of multiple votes for
certain qualifications was introduced. The Belgian citizen on
reaching the age of thirty-five, providing he is married or is a
widower with legitimate offspring and pays five francs of direct
taxes, gets a second vote. Two extra votes are given for qualifications
of property, official status or university diplomas. The
maximum voting power of any individual is three votes. In
1904 there were 1,581,649 voters, possessing 2,467,966 votes.
This system of plural voting has proved a success. It does not,
however, satisfy the Socialists, whose formula is one man, one
vote. The final change in the system of parliamentary elections
was made in 1899-1900, when proportional representation was
introduced. Proportional representation aims at the protection
of minorities, and its working out is a little intricate, or at all
events difficult to describe. The following has been accepted
as a clear definition of what proportional representation is:&mdash;&ldquo;Each
electoral district has the number of its members apportioned
in accordance with the total strength of each party or
political programme in that district. As a rule there are only the
three chief parties, viz. Catholic, Liberal and Socialist, but the
presence of Catholic-Democrats or some other new faction may
increase the total to four or even five. The number of seats to
be filled is divided by the number of parties or candidates, and
then they are distributed in the proportion of the total followers
or voters of each. The smallest minority is thus sure of one
seat.&rdquo; An illustration may make this clearer. In an electoral
district with 32,000 votes which returns eight deputies, four
parties send up candidates, let us say, eight Catholics, eight
Liberals, eight Socialists and one Catholic-Democrat. The
result of the voting is, 16,000 Catholic votes, 9000 Liberal, 4500
Socialist, and 2500 Catholic-Democrat. The seats would, therefore,
be apportioned as follows: four Catholic, two Liberal, one
Socialist and one Catholic-Democrat.</p>

<p>The king has one right which other constitutional rulers do
not possess. He can initiate proposals for new laws (<i>projets de
loi</i>). He is also charged with the executive power
which he delegates to a cabinet composed of ministers
<span class="sidenote">Administration.</span>
chosen from the party representing the majority
in the chamber. Down to 1884 the Liberal party had held
power with very few intervals since 1840. The Catholic party
succeeded to office in 1884. The ministers represent departments
for finance, foreign affairs, colonies, justice, the interior,
science and arts, war, railways, posts and telegraphs, agriculture,
public works, and industry and labour. The minister
for war is generally a soldier, the others are civilians.
Ministers may be members of either chamber and enjoy the
privilege of being allowed to speak in both. Sometimes one
minister will hold several portfolios at the same time, but such
cases are rare.</p>

<p>The kingdom is divided into nine provinces which are subdivided
into 342 cantons and 2623 communes. The provinces
are governed by a governor nominated by the king, the canton
is a judicial division for marking the limit of the jurisdiction of
each <i>juge de paix</i>, and the commune is the administrative unit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page671" id="page671"></a>671</span>
possessing self-government in all local matters. For each commune
<span class="sidenote">Provinces and communes.</span>
of 5000 inhabitants or over, a burgomaster is appointed by
the communal council which is chosen by the electors
of the commune. As three years&rsquo; residence is required
these electors are fewer in number than those
for the legislature. In 1902 there were 1,146,482
voters with 2,007,704 votes, the principles of multiple votes,
with, however, a maximum of four votes and proportional
representation, being in force for communal as for legislative
elections.</p>

<p><i>Religion</i>.&mdash;The constitution provides for absolute liberty of
conscience and there is no state religion, but the people are
almost to a man Roman Catholics. It is computed that there
are 10,000 Protestants (half English) and 5000 Jews, and that
all the rest are Catholics. The government in 1904 voted nearly
7,000,000 francs in aid of the religious establishments of, and
the benevolent institutions kept up by, the Roman Church.
The grant to other cults amounted to 118,000 francs, but small
as this sum may appear it is in due proportion to the relative
numbers of each creed. The hierarchy of the Church of Rome
in Belgium is composed of the archbishop of Malines, and the
bishops of Liége, Ghent, Bruges, Tournai and Namur. The
archbishop receives £800, and the bishops £600 apiece from the
state yearly. The pay of the village <i>curé</i> averages £80 a year
and a house. Besides the regular clergy there are the members
of the numerous monastic and conventual houses established in
Belgium. They are engaged principally in educational and
eleemosynary work, and the development in such institutions
is considerable.</p>

<p><i>Education</i>.&mdash;Education, though not obligatory, is free for
those who cannot pay for it. In the primary schools instruction
in reading, writing, arithmetic, history and geography is obligatory.
In 1904 there were 7092 primary schools with 859,436
pupils of both sexes. Of these 807,383 did not pay. Primary
education is supposed to continue till the age of fourteen, but in
practice it stops at twelve for all who do not intend to pass
through the middle schools, which is essential for all persons
seeking state employment of any kind. The middle schools
have one privilege. They can give a certificate qualifying
scholars for a mastership in the primary schools, which are
under the full control of the communes. These appointments
are always bestowed on local favourites. The pay of a schoolmaster
in a small commune is only £48, and in a large town £96,
with a maximum ranging from £80 to £152 after twenty-four
years&rsquo; service. It is therefore clear that no very high qualifications
could be expected from such a staff. The control of the
state comes in to the extent of providing district inspectors
who visit the schools once a year, and hold a meeting of the
teachers in their district once a quarter. In each province there
is a chief inspector who is bound to visit each school once in two
years, and reports direct to the minister of public instruction.
With regard to the middle schools, the government has reserved
the right to appoint the teaching staff, and to prescribe the books
that are to be used. The results of the middle schools are fairly
satisfactory. Still better are the Athénées Royaux, twenty in
number, which are quite independent of the commune and
subject to official control under the superior direction of the
king. Mathematics and classics are taught in them and the
masters are allowed to take boarders. The expenditure of the
state on education amounts to about a million sterling. In
1860 the grants were only for little over one-eighth of the total
in 1903. In 1900 31.94% of the toal population was illiterate.
Considerable progress in the education of the people is made
visible by a comparison of the figures of three decennial censuses.
In 1880 the illiterate were 42.25% and in 1890 37.63, so that
there was a further marked improvement by 1900. Among the
provinces Walloon Belgium is better instructed than Flemish,
Luxemburg coming first, followed by Namur, Liége and Brabant
in their order.</p>

<p>Higher instruction is given at the universities and in the
schools attached thereto. Those at Ghent and Liége are state
universities; the two others at Brussels and Louvain are free.
At Louvain alone is there a faculty of theology. The number of
students inscribed for the academical year 1904-1905 at each
university was Ghent 899, Liége 1983, Brussels 1082, and
Louvain 2134, or a grand total of 6098. Liége is specially
famed for the technical schools attached to it. There are also
a large number of state-aided schools for special purposes; (1) for
military instruction, there are the <i>École Militaire</i> at Brussels,
the school of cadets at Namur, and army schools at different
stations, <i>e.g.</i> Bouillon, &amp;c. For officers in the army, there are
the <i>École de Guerre</i> or staff college at Brussels with an average
attendance of twenty, a riding school at Ypres where a course is
obligatory for the cavalry and horse artillery, and for soldiers
in the army there are regimental schools and evening classes for
illiterate soldiers. (2) For education in the arts, there is the
Royal Academy of Fine Arts at Antwerp, and besides this
famous school of painting there are eighty-four academies for
teaching drawing throughout the kingdom. In music, there
are royal conservatoires at Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, and
Liége. Besides these there are sixty-nine minor conservatoires.
(3) For commercial and professional education, there are 181
schools. The Commercial Institute of Antwerp deserves special
notice as an excellent school for clerks. (4) Among special
schools may be named the three schools of navigation at Antwerp,
Ostend and Nieuport. Since the wreck of the training-ship
&ldquo;Comte de Smet de Naeyer&rdquo; in 1906, it has been decided that a
stationary training-ship shall be placed in the Scheldt like the
&ldquo;Worcester&rdquo; on the Thames. Among the numerous learned
societies may be mentioned the Belgian Royal Academy founded
in 1769 and revived in 1818. For the encouragement of research
and literary style the government awards periodical prizes which
are very keenly contested.</p>

<p><i>Justice</i>.&mdash;The administration of justice is very fully organized,
and in the Code Belge, which was carefully compiled between
1831 and 1836 from the old laws of the nine provinces leavened
by the Code Napoleon and modern exigencies, the Belgians
claim that they possess an almost perfect statute-book. The
courts of law in their order are <i>Cour de Cassation</i>, <i>Cour d&rsquo;Appel</i>,
<i>Cour de Première Instance</i>, and the <i>Juge de Paix</i> courts, one
for each of the 342 cantons. The <i>Cour de Cassation</i> has a
peculiar judicial sphere. It works automatically, examining
every judgment to see if it is in strict accord with the code,
and where it is not the decision or verdict is simply annulled.
There is only one judge in this court, but he has the assistance of
a large staff of revisers. The <i>Cour de Cassation</i> never tries a case
itself except when a minister of state is the accused. The
president of this tribunal is the highest legal functionary in
Belgium. There are three courts of appeal, viz. at Brussels,
Ghent and Liége. At Brussels there are four separate chambers
or tribunals in the appeal court. Judges of appeal are appointed
by the king for life from lists of eligible barristers prepared by
the senate and the courts. Judges can only be removed by the
unanimous vote of their brother judges. There are twenty-six
courts of first instance distributed among the principal towns
of the kingdom, and in Antwerp, Ghent and Liége there are
besides special tribunals for the settlement of commercial cases.
Of course there is the right of appeal from the decisions of these
tribunals as well as of the regular courts. Finally the 342 <i>Juge
de Paix</i> courts resemble British county courts. Criminal cases are
tried by (1) the <i>Tribunaux de Police</i>, (2) <i>Tribunaux Correctionnels</i>,
(3) and the <i>Cours d&rsquo;Assises</i>. The last are held as the length of
the calendar requires. Capital punishment is retained on the
statute, but is never enforced, the prisoner on whom sentence
of death is passed in due form in open court being relegated to
imprisonment for life in solitary confinement and perpetual
silence. The chief prisons are at Louvain, Ghent and St Gilles
(Brussels), and the last named serves as a house of detention.
At Merxplas, near the Dutch frontier, is the agricultural criminal
colony at which an average number of two thousand prisoners are
kept employed in comparative liberty within the radius of the
convict settlement.</p>

<p><i>Pauperism</i>.&mdash;For the relief of pauperism there are a limited
number of houses of mendicity, in which inmates are received,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page672" id="page672"></a>672</span>
and houses of refuge for night shelter. At the <i>béguinages</i> of
Ghent and Bruges women and girls able to contribute a specified
sum towards their support are given a home.</p>

<p><i>National Finance.</i>&mdash;The budget is submitted to the chambers
by the minister of finance and passed by them. The revenue
and expenditure were in the years stated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">The difference is made up of &ldquo;special expenditure.&rdquo; The total
debt in English money may be put at 126 millions sterling, which
requires for interest, sinking fund and service about 5¾ millions
sterling annually. The rate of interest on all the loans extant
is 3%, except on one loan of 219,959,632 francs, which pays
only 2½%.</p>

<p><i>Army and National Defence.</i>&mdash;The army is divided into the
regular army, the gendarmerie, and the <i>garde civique</i>. The
Belgian regular army is thus composed: infantry, one regiment
of carabiniers, one of grenadiers, three of <i>chasseurs à pied</i>, and
fourteen of the line, all these regiments having 3 or 4 active
and 3 or 4 reserve battalions apiece; cavalry, two regiments
of guides, two of <i>chasseurs à cheval</i>, and four of lancers,
all light cavalry; artillery, four horse, thirty field, and seventy
siege batteries on active service; engineers, 140 officers and
2000 men. The train or commissariat has only 30 officers
and 600 men on the permanent establishment. Belgium
retains the older form of conscription, and has not adopted the
system of &ldquo;universal service.&rdquo; The annual levy is small and
substitution is permitted. In 1904 the number inscribed for
service was 64,042. Of these only 12,525 were enrolled in the
army, and of that number 1421 were volunteers, who took an
engagement on receipt of a premium. The effective strength of
the army in 1904 with the colours was 3406 officers and 40,382
men. To this total has to be added the men on the active list,
but either absent on leave or allowed to return to civil life,
numbering 70,043. It is assumed that on mobilization these
men are immediately available. The reserve consists of 181
officers and 58,014 men, so that the total strength of the Belgian
army is 3587 officers and 168,439 men. The field force in war is
organized in four infantry and two cavalry divisions, the total
strength being about 100,000. The peace effective has not varied
much since 1870, but the total paper strength is 75,000 more
than in that year. In the years 1900-1904 it increased by 8000
men. The gendarmerie is a mounted force composed of men
picked for their physique and divided into three divisions. It
numbers 67 officers and 3079 men, but has no reserve. It is in
every sense a <i>corps d&rsquo;élite</i>, and may be classed as first-rate heavy
cavalry. The total strength of the <i>garde civique</i> in 1905 was
35,102, to which have to be added 8532 volunteers belonging to
the corps of older formation, service in which counts on a par
with the <i>garde civique</i>. Some of the latter regiments, especially
the artillery, would rank with British volunteers, but the mass
of the <i>garde civique</i> does not pretend to possess military value.
It is a defence against sedition and socialism. The defence of
Belgium depends on five fortified positions. The fortified position
and camp of Antwerp represents the true base of the national
defence. Its detached forts shelter the city from bombardment,
and so long as sea communication is open with England, Antwerp
would be practically impregnable. Liége with twelve forts and
Namur with nine forts are the fortified <i>têtes de pont</i> protecting
the two most important passages of the Meuse. The forts are
constructed in concrete with armoured cupolas. Termonde on
the Scheldt and Diest on the Dender are retained as nominally
fortified positions, but neither, could resist a regular bombardment
for more than a few hours, as their casemates are not
bomb-proof.</p>

<p>The training camp of the Belgian army is at Beverloo in the
province of Limburg, and at Braschaet not far from Antwerp
are ranges for artillery as well as rifle practice. The Belgian
officer is technically as well trained and educated as any in
Europe, but he lacks practical experience in military service.</p>

<p><i>Mines and Industry.</i>&mdash;The principal mineral produced in
Belgium is coal. This is found in the Borinage district near
Mons and in the neighbourhood of Liége, but the working of an
entirely new coal-field, which promises to attain vast dimensions,
was commenced in 1906 in the Campine district of the province
of Limburg. The coal mines of Belgium give employment to
nearly 150,000 persons, and for some years the average output
has exceeded 22,000,000 tons. Other minerals are iron, manganese,
lead and zinc. The iron mines produce much less than formerly,
and the want of iron is a grave defect in Belgian prosperity, as
about £5,000,000 sterling worth of iron has to be imported annually,
chiefly from French Lorraine. The chief metal industry of the
country is represented by the iron and steel works of Charleroi
and Liége. Belgium is particularly rich in quarries of marble,
granite and slate. Ghent is the capital of the textile industry,
and all the towns of Flanders are actively engaged in producing
woollen and cotton materials and in lace manufacture. The
bulk of the population is, however, engaged in agriculture,
and the extent of land under cultivation of all kinds is about
6½ million acres.</p>

<p><i>Commerce.</i>&mdash;The trade returns for 1904 were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcl">&emsp;&emsp;<i>Imports&mdash;</i></td> <td class="tcl">&nbsp;</td></tr>

<p>The general commerce includes goods in transit across Belgium,
the special commerce takes into account only the produce and
the consumption of Belgium itself. The trade of Belgium has
more than trebled as regards both imports and exports since
1870. The following table shows the amount of exports and imports

<p class="noind">In the relative magnitude of the annual value of its commerce,
excluding that in transit, Belgium stands sixth among the nations
of the world, following Great Britain, the United States, Germany,
France and Holland. The principal imports are food supplies
and raw material such as cotton, wool, silk, flax, hemp and jute.
Among minerals, iron ore, sulphur, copper, coal, tin, lead and
diamonds are the most imported. The exports of greatest value
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page673" id="page673"></a>673</span>
are textiles, lace, coal, coke, briquettes, glass, machinery, railway
material and fire arms.</p>

<p><i>Shipping and Navigation.</i>&mdash;Belgium has no state navy, although
various proposals have been made from time to time to establish
an armed flotilla in connexion with the defence of Antwerp.
The state, however, possesses a certain number of steamers.
In 1904 they numbered sixty-five of 99,893 tons. These steamers
are chiefly employed on the passenger route between Ostend
and Dover. The total number of vessels entering the only two
ports of Belgium which carry on ocean commerce, namely
Antwerp and Ostend, in 1904 was 7650 of a tonnage of 10,330,127.
Among inland ports that of Ghent is the most important, 1127
ships of a tonnage of 786,362 having entered the port in 1904.
The corresponding figures for ships sailing from the two ports
first named were in the same year 7642 and tonnage 10,298,405.
The figures from Ghent were 1128 and 787,173 tons. Whereas
the lines of steamers from Ostend are chiefly with Dover and
London, those from Antwerp proceed to all parts of the world.
A steam service was established in 1906 from Hull to Bruges by
Zeebrugge and the ship canal.</p>

<p><i>Internal Communications.</i>&mdash;The internal communications of
Belgium of every kind are excellent. The roads outside the
province of Luxemburg and Namur are generally paved. In
the provinces named, or in other words, in the region south
of the Meuse, the roads are macadamized. The total length of
roads is about 6000 m. When Belgium became a separate state
in 1830 they were less than one-third of this total. There are
about 2900 m. of railways, of which upwards of 2500 m. are
state railways. It is of interest to note that the state railways
derived a revenue of 249,355 francs (or nearly £10,000) from
the penny tickets for the admission of non-travellers to railway
stations. Besides the main railways there are numerous light
railways (<i>chemins de fer vicinaux</i>), of a total length approaching
2500 m. There are also electric and steam tramways in all
the principal cities. The total of navigable waterways is given
as 1360 m. Posts, telegraphs and telephones are exclusively
under state management and form a government department.</p>

<p><i>Banks and Money.</i>&mdash;The principal banking institution is the
Banque Nationale which issues the bank-notes in current use. In
1904 the average value of notes in circulation was 645,989,100 francs.
The rate of discount was 3% throughout the whole of the year.</p>

<p>The mintage of Belgian money is carried out by a <i>directeur
de la fabrication</i> who is nominated by and responsible to the

for half francs, francs, 2 francs and 5 francs. Nickel money is
for 5, 10 and 20 centimes, and the copper coinage has been

<p>The political severance of the northern and southern Netherlands
may be conveniently dated from the opening of the year
1579. By the signing of the league of Arras (5th of January)
the Walloon &ldquo;Malcontents&rdquo; declared their adherence to the
cause of Catholicism and their loyalty to the Spanish king, and
broke away definitely from the northern provinces, who bound
themselves by the union of Utrecht (29th of January) to defend
their rights and liberties, political and religious, against all
<span class="sidenote1">Final separation of the northern and southern Netherlands.</span>
foreign potentates. Brabant and Flanders were still indeed under
the control of the prince of Orange and through his
influence accepted in 1582 the duke of Anjou as their
sovereign. The French prince was actually inaugurated
duke of Brabant at Antwerp (February 1582) and count
of Flanders at Bruges (July), but his misconduct
speedily led to his withdrawal from the Netherlands,
and even before the assassination of Orange (July
1584) the authority of Philip had been practically restored
throughout the two provinces. This had been achieved by the
military skill and statesmanlike abilities of Alexander
<span class="sidenote1">Alexander Farnese, prince of Parma, governor-general.
<br />Successes of Parma.</span>
Farnese, prince of Parma, appointed governor-general
on the death of Don John of Austria, on the
1st of October 1578. Farnese first won by promises
and blandishments the confidence of the Walloons,
always jealous of the predominance of the &ldquo;Flemish&rdquo;
provinces, and then proceeded to make himself master of Brabant
and Flanders by force of arms. In succession Ypres, Mechlin,
Ghent, Brussels, and finally Antwerp (17th of August
1585) fell into his hands. Philip had in the southern
Netherlands attained his object, and Belgium was
henceforth Catholic and Spanish, but at the expense of its
progress and prosperity. Thousands of its inhabitants, and
those the most enterprising and intelligent, fled from the Inquisition,
and made their homes in the Dutch republic or in England.
All commerce and industry was at a standstill; grass grew in
the streets of Bruges and Ghent; and the trade of Antwerp was
transferred to Amsterdam. On Parma&rsquo;s death (3rd of December
1592) the archduke Ernest of Austria was appointed governor-general,
but he died after a short tenure of office (20th of February
1595) and was at the beginning of 1596 succeeded by his younger
brother the cardinal archduke Albert. Philip was now nearing
<span class="sidenote1">Albert and Isabel, sovereigns of the Netherlands.</span>
his end, and in 1598 he gave his eldest daughter Isabel
in marriage to her cousin the archduke Albert, and
erected the Netherlands into a sovereign state under
their joint rule. The advent of the new sovereigns,
officially known as &ldquo;the archdukes,&rdquo; though greeted
with enthusiasm in the Belgic provinces, was looked
upon with suspicion by the Dutch, who were as firmly resolved
as ever to uphold their independence. The chief military
event of the early years of their reign was the battle of Nieuport
<span class="sidenote1">The twelve years&rsquo; truce.
<br />The rule of the archdukes.</span>
(2nd of July 1600), in which Maurice of Nassau defeated
the archduke Albert, and the siege of Ostend, which
after a three years&rsquo; heroic defence was surrendered
(20th of September 1604) to the archduke&rsquo;s general,
Spinola. The Dutch, however, being masters of the sea, kept
the coast closely blockaded, and through sheer exhaustion the
king of Spain and the archdukes were compelled to
agree to a truce for twelve years (9th of April 1609)
with the United Provinces &ldquo;in the capacity of free
states over which Albert and Isabel made no pretensions.&rdquo;
During the period of the truce the archdukes, who were
wise and statesmanlike rulers, did their utmost to restore
<span class="sidenote1">Reversion of the southern Netherlands to Spain, 1633.</span>
prosperity to their country and to improve its internal
condition. Unfortunately they were childless, and
the instrument of cession of 1598 provided that in
case they should die without issue, the Netherlands
should revert to the crown of Spain. This reversion
actually took place. Albert died in 1621, just before the
renewal of the war with the Dutch, and Isabel in 1633.
The Belgic provinces therefore passed under the rule of Philip IV.,
and were henceforth known as the Spanish Netherlands.</p>

<p>This connexion with the declining fortunes of Spain was
disastrous to the well-being of the Belgian people, for during
many years a close alliance bound together France and the
United Provinces, and the Southern Netherlands were exposed
<span class="sidenote1">Peace of Münster.</span>
to attack from both sides, and constantly suffered
from the ravages of hostile armies. The cardinal archduke
Ferdinand, governor-general from 1634-1641, was
a capable ruler, and by his military skill prevented in a succession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page674" id="page674"></a>674</span>
of campaigns the forces of the enemy from overrunning the
country. On the 30th of January 1648, Spain concluded a
separate peace at Münster with the Dutch, by which Philip IV.
<span class="sidenote1">Ruinous consequences of the closing of the Scheldt.</span>
finally renounced all his claims and rights over the
United Provinces, and made many concessions to them.
Among these was the closing of the Scheldt to all ships,
a clause which was ruinous to the commerce of the
Belgic provinces, by cutting them off from their only
access to the ocean. Thus they remained for a long
course of years without a sea-port, and in the many wars that
broke out between Spain and France were constantly exposed,
as an outlying Spanish dependency, to the first attack, and peace
when it came was usually purchased at the cost of some part of
Belgian territory. By the treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) Artois
<span class="sidenote1">Successive cession of Belgian territory to France.</span>
(except St Omer and Aire) and a number of towns in
Flanders, Hainaut, and Luxemburg were ceded to
France. Subsequent French conquests, confirmed by
the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668), took away Lille,
Douai, Charleroi, Oudenarde, Coutrai and Tournai.
These were, indeed, partly restored to Belgium by the peace of
Nijmwegen (1679); but on the other hand it lost Valenciennes,
Nieuport, St Omer, Ypres and Charlemont, which were only in
part recovered by the peace of Ryswick (1697).</p>

<p>The internal history of the Belgic provinces has little to record
during this long period in which the ambition of Louis XIV. to
possess himself of the Netherlands, in right of his wife the infanta
Maria Theresa (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spanish Succession</a></span>), led to a series of
invasions and desolating wars. The French king managed to
incorporate a large slice of territory upon his northern frontier,
but his main object was baffled by the steady resistance and able
statesmanship of William III. of England and Holland. Meanwhile
from 1692 onwards brighter prospects were opened out to
the unfortunate Belgians by the nomination by the Spanish king
of Maximilian Emanuel, elector of Bavaria, to be governor-general
with well-nigh sovereign powers. The elector had himself
a claim to the inheritance as the husband of an Austrian archduchess,
whose mother, the infanta Margaret, was the younger
sister of the French queen. Maximilian Emanuel was an able
man, who did his utmost to improve the condition of the country.
<span class="sidenote1">Efforts of the elector of Bavaria to promote trade.</span>
He attempted to promote trade and restore prosperity
to the impoverished land by the introduction of new
customs laws and other measures, and particularly by
the construction of canals to counteract the damage
done to Belgian commerce by the closing of the Scheldt.
The position of the elector was greatly strengthened by the
partition treaty of the 19th of August 1698. Under this instrument
the signatory powers&mdash;England, France and Holland&mdash;agreed
that on the demise of Charles II. the crown prince of
Bavaria under his father&rsquo;s guardianship should be sovereign of
Spain, Belgium and Spanish America. Charles II. himself
<span class="sidenote1">The Spanish succession.</span>
shortly afterwards by will appointed the Bavarian
prince heir to all his dominions.
The death of the infant heir a few months later (6th of February 1699)
unfortunately destroyed any prospects of a peaceable
settlement of the Spanish Succession. Charles II. was persuaded
to name as his sole successor, Philip duke of Anjou, the second
son of the dauphin, and on his death (on the 1st November 1700)
Louis XIV. took immediate steps to support his grandson&rsquo;s
claims, in spite of his formal renunciation of such claims under
<span class="sidenote1">The Grand Alliance.</span>
the treaty of the Pyrenees. England and Holland were determined to prevent, however,
at all costs the acquisition of Belgium by a French prince, and a
coalition, known as the Grand Alliance, was formed between
these two powers and the empire to uphold the claims of the
archduke Charles, second son of the emperor.</p>

<p>One of the first steps of Louis was to take possession of the
Netherlands. The hereditary feud between the houses of
Austria and Bavaria induced the elector to take the
<span class="sidenote1">Marlborough&rsquo;s successes.</span>
side of France, and he was nominated by Philip V.
vicar-general of the Netherlands. The unhappy Belgic
provinces were again doomed for a number of years to
be the battle-ground of the contending forces, and it was on
Belgic soil that Marlborough won the great victories of Ramillies
(1706) and of Oudenarde (1708), by which he was enabled to drive
the French armies out of the Netherlands and to carry the war
into French territory. At the general peace concluded at
Utrecht (11th of April 1713) the long connexion between Belgium
<span class="sidenote1">Peace of Utrecht.
<br />The Austrian Netherlands.</span>
and Spain was severed, and this portion of the Burgundian
inheritance of Charles V. placed under the
sovereignty of the Habsburg claimant, who had, by
the death of his brother, become the emperor Charles VI.
The Belgic provinces now came for a full century to be known as the
Austrian Netherlands. Yet such was the dread of
France and the enfeebled state of the country that
Holland retained the privilege, which had been conceded
to her during the war, of garrisoning the principal
fortresses or Barrier towns, on the French frontier, and her
right to close the navigation on the Scheldt was again ratified by
a European treaty. The beginnings of Austrian sovereignty
were marked by many collisions between the representatives
of the new rulers and the States General, and provincial &ldquo;states.&rdquo;
<span class="sidenote1">Marquis de Prié in Belgium.</span>
Despite their troubled history and long subjection,
the Belgic provinces still retained to an unusual
degree their local liberties and privileges, and more
especially the right of not being taxed, except by the
express consent of the states. The marquis de Prié, who (as
deputy for Prince Eugene) was the imperial governor from 1719
to 1726, encountered on the part of local authorities and town
gilds vigorous resistance to his attempt to rule the Netherlands
as an Austrian dependency, and he was driven to take strong
<span class="sidenote1">Execution of Francis Anneesens.</span>
measures to assert his authority. He selected as his
victim a powerful popular leader at Brussels,
Francis Anneesens, syndic of the gild of St Nicholas, who was
beheaded on the 19th of September 1719. His name
is remembered in Belgian annals as a patriot martyr to the
cause of liberty. The administration of de Prié was not, however,
without its redeeming features. He endeavoured to create
at Ostend a seaport, capable in some measure
to take the place of Antwerp, and in 1722 a Chartered Company of Ostend
<span class="sidenote1">Chartered Company of Ostend.</span>
was erected for the purpose of trading in the East and
West Indies (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ostend</a></span>). The determined hostility
of the Dutch rendered the promising scheme futile,
and after a precarious struggle for existence, Charles VI., in order
to gain the assent of the United Provinces and Great Britain to
the Pragmatic Sanction (<i>q.v.</i>), suppressed the Company in 1731.</p>

<p>For sixteen years (1725-1741) the archduchess Mary Elizabeth,
sister of the emperor, filled the post of governor-general. Her
rule was marked by the restoration of the old form
<span class="sidenote">Archduchess Mary Elizabeth.</span>
of administration under the three councils, and was
a period of general tranquillity.
She died (1741) in the Netherlands, and the empress-queen,
Maria Theresa, who had succeeded under the Pragmatic Sanction
to the Burgundian domains of her father about a year before,
appointed her brother-in-law, Charles of Lorraine, to be
governor-general in her aunt&rsquo;s place, and he retained that post,
to the great advantage of Belgium, for nearly forty years.
<span class="sidenote">Charles of Lorraine.</span>
He was deservedly known as the &ldquo;Good Governor.&rdquo;
The first years of his administration were stormy.
During the Austrian War of Succession the country was conquered
by the French, and for two years Marshal Saxe bore the title of
governor-general, but it was restored to Austria by the peace of
Aix-la-Chapelle (1748). Belgium was undisturbed by the Seven
Years&rsquo; War (1756-1763), and during the long peace which followed
enjoyed considerable prosperity. Charles of Lorraine thoroughly
identified himself with the best interests of the country, and was
the champion of its liberties, and though he had at times to make
a stand against the imperialistic tendencies of the chancellor
Kaunitz, he was able to rely on the steady support of the empress,
who appreciated the wise and liberal policy of her brother-in-law.
Although the Scheldt was still closed, Charles endeavoured by
a large extension of the canal system to facilitate commercial
intercourse, he encouraged agriculture, and was successful in
restoring the prosperity of the country. He also did much for
the advancement of learning, founding, among other institutions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page675" id="page675"></a>675</span>
the Academy of Science, and he consistently restrained the undue
intervention of the church in secular affairs, and placed restrictions
upon the accumulation of property in the hands of
religious bodies.</p>

<p>The death of Charles of Lorraine preceded only by a few
months that of Maria Theresa, whose son Joseph II. not only
appointed his sister, the archduchess Maria Christine,
governor-general, but visited Belgium in person and
<span class="sidenote">Reforming zeal of Joseph II.</span>
showed a great and active interest in its affairs.
Here as elsewhere in his dominions his intentions
were excellent, but his reforming zeal outran discretion, and his
hasty and self-opinionated interferences with treaty rights and
traditional privileges ended in provoking opposition and disaster.
Finding the United Provinces hampered by a war with England,
he seized the opportunity to try to get rid of the impediments
placed upon Belgian development by the Barrier and other
treaties with Holland. He was able to compel the Dutch to
withdraw their garrisons from the Barrier towns, but was wholly
unsuccessful in his high-handed attempt to free the navigation
of the Scheldt. These efforts to coerce the Dutch, though
marred by partial failure, were, however, calculated to win for
Joseph II. popularity with his Belgian subjects; but it was far
otherwise with his policy of internal reform. He offended the
states by seeking to sweep away many of their inherited privileges
and to change the time-honoured, if somewhat obsolete, system
of civil government. He further excited the religious feelings
of the people against him, by his edict of Tolerance (1780), and
his later attempts at the reform of clerical abuses, which were
pronounced to be an infraction of the Joyous Entry (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Joyeuse
Entrée</a></span>). Fierce opposition was aroused. Numbers of malcontents
left the country and organized themselves as a military
force in Holland. As the discontent became more general, the
<span class="sidenote">The Brabancon revolt.</span>
insurgents returned, took several forts, defeated the
Austrians at Turnhout, and overran the country.
On the 11th of December 1789, the people of Brussels
rose against the Austrian garrison, and compelled it to
capitulate, and, on the 27th, the states of Brabant declared
their independence. The other provinces followed and, on the
11th of January 1790, the whole formed themselves into an
independent state, under the name of the &ldquo;Belgian United
States.&rdquo; A few weeks later, on the 20th of February, Joseph II.
died, his end hastened by chagrin at the utter failure of his well-meant
efforts, and was succeeded by Leopold II.</p>

<p>The new emperor at once took steps to re-assert, if possible,
his authority in Belgium without having recourse to armed
force. He offered the states, if the people would return
to their allegiance, the restoration of their ancient
<span class="sidenote">Leopold II. pacifies the country.</span>
constitution and a general amnesty. This, however,
did not suit views of the popular party, who, under
the leadership of an advocate named Van der Noot, had possession
of the reins of power, and were uplifted by their success.
The terms offered in an imperial proclamation were rejected,
and preparations were made to resist coercion by the <i>levée en
masse</i> of a national army. When, however, in November 1790,
a powerful Austrian force entered the country, there was practically
little opposition to its advance. The popular leaders
fled, the form of government, as it existed at the end of the
reign of Maria Theresa, and an amnesty for past offences was
proclaimed; a superficial pacification of the revolted provinces
was effected, and Austrian rule re-established. It was destined
to be short-lived. In 1792 the armies of revolutionary France
assailed Austria at her weakest point by an invasion of Belgium.
The battle of Jemappes (7th of November) made the French
<span class="sidenote">Conquest of Belgium by the French.</span>
masters of the southern portion of the Austrian
Netherlands; the battle of Fleurus (26th of June 1794)
put an end to the rule of the Habsburgs over the Belgic
provinces. The treaty of Campo Formio (1797) and
the subsequent treaty of Lunéville (1801) confirmed the conquerors
in the possession of the country, and Belgium became
an integral part of France, being governed on the same footing,
receiving the <i>Code Napoléon</i>, and sharing in the fortunes of the
Republic and the Empire. After the fall of Napoleon and the
conclusion of the first peace of Paris (30th of May 1814)
Belgium was indeed for some months placed under the administration
<span class="sidenote">Union of Holland and Belgium under William I.</span>
of an Austrian governor-general, but it
was shortly afterwards united with Holland to form
the kingdom of the Netherlands. The sovereignty
of the newly formed state was given to the prince of
Orange, who mounted the throne (23rd of March 1815)
under the title of William I. The congress of Vienna
(31st of May 1815) determined the relations and fixed the
boundaries of the kingdom; and the new constitution was promulgated
on the 24th of August following, the king taking the
oath at Brussels on the 27th of September.</p>

<p>From this date until the Belgian revolt of 1830, the history
of Holland and Belgium is that of two portions of one political
entity, but in the relations of those two portions were
to be found from the very outset fundamental causes
<span class="sidenote">1814-1830.</span>
tending to disagreement and separation. The Dutch
and Belgian provinces of the Netherlands had for one hundred
and thirty years passed through totally different experiences,
and had drifted farther and farther apart from one another
in character, in habits, in ideas and above all in religion. In
the south the policy of Alva and Philip II. had been wholly
successful, and the Belgian people, Flemings and Walloons alike,
were perhaps more devoted to the Catholic faith than any other
in Europe. On the other hand the incorporation of the country
for two decades in the French republic and empire had left deep
traces on a considerable section of the population, the French
language was commonly spoken and was exclusively used in
the law courts and in all public proceedings, and French political
theories had made many converts. The Fundamental Law
promulgated by William I. aroused strong opposition among
both the Catholic and Liberal parties in Belgium. The large
powers granted to the king under the new constitution displeased
the Liberals, who saw in its provision only a disguised form of
personal government. The principle of liberty of worship and of
the press, which it laid down, was so offensive to the Catholics
that the bishops condemned it publicly, and in the Doctrinal
Judgment actually forbade their flocks to take the oath. The
&ldquo;close and complete union,&rdquo; which was stipulated under the
treaty of 1814, began under unfavourable auspices. Nevertheless
the difficulties might have been smoothed away in the course
of time, had the Belgians felt that the Dutch were treating
them in a fair and conciliatory spirit. This, despite the undoubtedly
good intentions of the king, was far from being the
case. Belgium was regarded too much in the light of an annexed
<span class="sidenote">Causes of disagreement between Holland and Belgium.</span>
territory, handed over to Holland as compensation for
the losses sustained by the Dutch in the revolutionary
and Napoleonic wars. The idea that Holland was the
predominant partner in the kingdom of the Netherlands
was firmly rooted in the north and naturally provoked
in the south the feeling that Belgium was being exploited
for the benefit of the Dutch. The grievances of
the Belgians were indeed very substantial. The seat of government
was in Holland, the king was a Dutchman by birth and
training, and a Calvinistic protestant by religion. Though the
population of Belgium was 3,400,000 and that of Holland only
a little more than 2,000,000 the two countries had equal representation
in the second chamber of the states-general. Practically
in all important legislative measures affecting the interests
of the two countries the Dutch government were able to command
a small but permanent majority. The use of the term
&ldquo;the Dutch Government&rdquo; is strictly accurate, for the great
majority of the public offices were filled by northerners. In
1830, of the seven members of the ministry only one was a
Belgian; in the home department out of 117 officials 11 only
were Belgians; in the ministry of war 3 were Belgians out of
102; of the officers of the army 288 out of 1967. All the public
<span class="sidenote">Attitude of the king.</span>
establishments, the Bank, the military schools, were
Dutch. That such was the case must not be entirely
charged to partiality, still less to deliberate unfairness
on the part of William I. The conduct of the king
proves that he had a most sincere regard for the welfare of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page676" id="page676"></a>676</span>
Belgian subjects, and in his choice of measures and men his
aim was to secure the prosperity of his new kingdom by a policy
of unification. This was the object he had in view in his attempt
to make Dutch, except in the Walloon districts, the official
language for all public and judicial acts, and a knowledge of
Dutch a necessary qualification for every person entering the
public service. That the fierce opposition which this attempt
<span class="sidenote">Language question.</span>
aroused in the Flemish-speaking provinces was ill-considered
and unwise, is shown by the fact that in
recent years there has been a patriotic movement
in these same provinces which has been successful in forcing
the Belgian government to adopt Flemish (<i>i.e.</i> Dutch) as well as
French for official usage. This Flemish movement is all in favour
of establishing close relations with the sister people of the north.
Moreover it cannot be gainsaid that Belgium during her union
with Holland enjoyed a degree of prosperity that
<span class="sidenote">Belgian prosperity during the union.</span>
was quite remarkable. The mineral wealth of the
country was largely developed, the iron manufactures
of Liége made rapid advance, the woollen manufactures
of Verviers received a similar impulse, and many large
establishments were formed at Ghent and other places, where
cotton goods were produced which rivalled those of England and
surpassed those of France. The extensive colonial and foreign
trade of the Dutch furnished them with markets, while the
opening of the navigation of the Scheldt raised Antwerp once
more to a place of high commercial importance. The government
also did much in the way of improving the internal communications
of the country, in repairing the roads and canals,
in forming new ones, in deepening and widening rivers, and the
like. Nor was the social and intellectual improvement of the
people by any means neglected. A new university was formed at
Liége, normal schools for the instruction of teachers were instituted,
and numerous elementary schools and schools for higher
instruction were established over the country. These measures
for the furthering of education among the people on the part
of a government mainly composed of Protestants were received
with suspicion and disfavour by the priests, and still more the
attempts subsequently made to regulate the education of the
priests themselves. The establishment under the auspices of
the king in 1825 of the Philosophical College at Louvain, and
the requirement that every priest before ordination should
spend two years in study there, gave great offence to the clerical
party, and some of the bishops were prosecuted for the violence
of their denunciations at this intrusion of the secular arm into
the religious domain. With the view of terminating these
differences the king in 1827 entered into a <i>concordat</i> with the
pope, and an agreement was reached with regard to nominations
to bishoprics, clerical education and other questions, which
should have satisfied all reasonable men. But in 1828 the two
extreme parties, the Catholic Ultramontanes and the revolutionary
Liberals, in their common hatred to the Dutch régime,
formed an alliance, the <i>union</i>, for the overthrow of the government.
Petitions were sent in setting forth the Belgian grievances,
demanding a separate administration for Belgium and a full
concession of the liberties guaranteed by the constitution.</p>

<p>Matters were in this state when the news of the success of the
July revolution of 1830 at Paris reached Brussels, at this time
a city of refuge for the intriguing and discontented
of almost every country of Europe. The first outbreak
<span class="sidenote">Brussels outbreak of 1830.</span>
took place on the 25th of August, the anniversary
of the king&rsquo;s accession. An opera called <i>La Muette</i>,
which abounds in appeals to liberty, was played, and the audience
were so excited that they rushed out into the street crying,
&ldquo;Imitons les Parisiens!&rdquo; A mob speedily gathered together,
who proceeded to destroy or damage a number of public buildings
and the private residences of unpopular officials. The troops
were few in number and offered no opposition to the mob, but
a burgher guard was enrolled among the influential and middle-class
citizens for the protection of life and property. The intelligence
of these events in the capital soon spread through the
provinces; and in most of the large towns similar scenes were
enacted, beginning with plunderings and outrages, followed
by the institution of burgher guards for the maintenance of peace.
The leading men of Brussels were most anxious not to push
matters to extremities. They demanded the dismissal of the
specially obnoxious minister, Van Maanen, and a separate administration
for Belgium. The government, however, could not
make up their minds what course to pursue, and by allowing
things to drift ended by converting a popular riot into a national
revolt. The heir apparent, the prince of Orange (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">William II.</a></span>
of the Netherlands), was sent on a peaceful mission to Brussels,
but furnished with such limited powers, as under the circumstances
were utterly inadequate. He did his best to get at the
real facts, and after a number of conferences with the leaders
became so convinced that nothing but a separate administration
of the two countries would restore tranquillity that he promised
to use his influence with his father to bring about that object&mdash;on
receiving assurances that the personal union under the house
of Orange would be maintained. The king summoned an extraordinary
session of the states-general, which met at the Hague on
the 13th of September and was opened by a speech from the
throne, which was firm and temperate, but by no means definite.
The proceedings were dilatory, and the attitude of the Dutch
deputies exceedingly exasperating. The result was that the
moderate party in Belgium quickly lost their influence, and
those in favour of violent measures prevailed. Meanwhile
although the states were still sitting at the Hague, an army
of 14,000 troops under the command of Prince Frederick, second
son of the king, was gradually approaching Brussels. It was
hoped that the inhabitants would welcome the prince and that
a display of armed force would speedily restore order. After
much unnecessary delay, at a time when prompt action was
required, the prince on the 23rd of September entered Brussels
and, with little opposition, occupied the upper or court portion
of it, but when they attempted to advance into the lower town
the troops found the streets barricaded and defended by citizens
in arms. Desultory fighting between the soldiers and the
insurgents continued for three days until, finding that he was
making no headway, the prince ordered a retreat. The news
spread like wildfire through the country, and the principal
towns declared for separation. A provisional government was
formed at Brussels, which declared Belgium to be an independent
state, and summoned a national congress to establish a system
of government. King William now did his utmost to avoid
a rupture, and sent the prince of Orange to Antwerp to promise
that Belgium should have a separate administration; but it
was too late. Antwerp was the only important place that remained
in the hands of the Dutch, and the army on retreating
from Brussels had fallen back on this town. At the end of
October an insurgent army had arrived before the gates, which
were opened by the populace to receive them, and the troops,
under General Chassé, retired within the citadel. The general
ordered a bombardment of the town for two days, destroying
a number of houses and large quantities of merchandize. This
act served still further to inflame the minds of the Belgians
against the Dutch.</p>

<p>A convention of the representatives of the five great powers
met in London in the beginning of November, at the request
of the king of the Netherlands, and both sides were
brought to consent to a cessation of hostilities. On the
<span class="sidenote">Meeting of the National Congress.</span>
10th of November the National Congress, consisting
of 200 deputies, met at Brussels and came to three
important decisions: (1) the independence of the country&mdash;carried
unanimously; (2) a constitutional hereditary monarchy&mdash;174
votes against 13; (3) the perpetual exclusion of the
Orange-Nassau family&mdash;161 votes against 28. On the 20th of
December the conference of London proclaimed the dissolution
of the kingdom of the Netherlands, but claimed the right of
regulating the conditions under which it should take place.
On the 28th of January 1831, the congress proceeded to the
election of a king, and out of a number of candidates the choice
fell on the duke of Nemours, second son of Louis Philippe, but
he declined the office. The congress then elected Baron Surlet
de Chokier to the temporary post of regent, and proceeded to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page677" id="page677"></a>677</span>
draw up a constitution on the British parliamentary pattern. The
constitution expressly declared that the king has no powers
except those formally assigned to him. Ministers were to be
<span class="sidenote">The new constitution.</span>
appointed by him, but be responsible to the chambers.
The legislature was composed of two chambers&mdash;the
senate and the chamber of deputies. Both chambers
were elected by the same voters, but senators
required a property qualification,&mdash;the payment of at least
2000 florins in taxes. Senators and deputies received salaries.
The franchise was for that time a low one&mdash;every one who paid
at least 20 florins in taxes had a vote. The choice of a king was
more difficult than that of drawing up a constitution. It was
desirable that the new sovereign should be able to count upon
the friendly support of the great powers, and yet not be actually
a member of their reigning dynasties. It was from fear of
arousing the susceptibilities of neighbouring states, especially
Great Britain, that Louis Philippe had refused to sanction the
election of his son. It was for this reason that the name of
Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, the widower of Princess Charlotte of
England, had not been placed among the candidates in January.
Overtures were, however, made to him, as soon as it was understood
that, as the result of private negotiations at the London
conference, the selection of this prince would be favourably
<span class="sidenote">Leopold I., king of the Belgians.</span>
received both by Great Britain and France. Leopold
signified his readiness to accept the crown after having
first ascertained that he would have the support of
the great powers in bringing about a satisfactory
settlement with Holland on those points which he considered
essential to the security and welfare of the new kingdom. The
election took place on the 4th of June, when 152 votes out of 196,
four being absent, determined that Leopold should be proclaimed
king of the Belgians, under the express condition that he &ldquo;would
accept the constitution and swear to maintain the national
independence and territorial integrity.&rdquo; Leopold made his
public entry into Brussels, on the 21st, and subsequently visited
other parts of the kingdom, and was everywhere received with
demonstrations of loyalty and respect.</p>

<p>At this juncture news suddenly arrived that the Dutch were
preparing to invade the country with a large army. It comprised
45,000 infantry and 6000 cavalry with 72 pieces of artillery,
while Leopold could scarcely bring forward 25,000 men to oppose
it. On the 2nd of August the whole of the Dutch army had
crossed the frontier; Leopold collected his forces, such as they
were, near Louvain in order to cover his capital. The two armies
met on the 9th of August. The undisciplined Belgians, despite
the personal efforts of their king, were speedily routed, and
Leopold and his staff narrowly escaped capture. He, however,
made good his retreat to the capital, and, on the advance of a
French army, the prince of Orange did not deem it prudent to
push on farther. A convention was concluded between him
and the French general, in consequence of which he returned
to Holland and the French likewise recrossed the frontier.
Leopold now proceeded with vigour to strengthen his position
and to restore order and confidence. French officers were
selected for the training and disciplining of the army, the civil
list was arranged with economy and order, and reforms were
introduced into the public service and system of administration.
He kept on the best of terms, though a Protestant, with the
Roman Catholic clergy and nobility, and his subsequent marriage
with the daughter of the French king (9th of August 1832),
and the contract that the children of the marriage should be
brought up in the Roman Catholic faith, did much to inspire
confidence in his good intentions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the conference in London had drawn up the
project of a treaty for the separation of Holland and Belgium,
which was declared &ldquo;to be final and irrevocable.&rdquo;
The conditions were far less favourable to Belgium
<span class="sidenote">The treaty of separation.</span>
than had been hoped, and it was not without much
heart-burning and considerable opposition, that the
senate and chamber of deputies gave their assent to them.
The treaty, which contained 24 articles, was signed on the
15th of November 1831. By these articles the grand-duchy
of Luxemburg was divided, but the king of Holland retained
possession of the fortress of Luxemburg, and also received a
portion of Limburg to compensate him for the part of Luxemburg
assigned to Belgium. The district of Maestricht was likewise
partitioned, but the fortress remained Dutch. The Scheldt
was declared open to the commerce of both countries. The
national debt was divided. The powers recognized the independence
of Belgium, &ldquo;as a neutral state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This agreement was ratified by the Belgian and French
sovereigns on the 20th and 24th of November, by the British
on the 6th of December, but the Austrian and Prussian and
Russian governments, whose sympathies were with the
&ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; King William rather than with a prince who
owed his crown to a revolution, did not give their ratification
till some five months later. Even then King William remained
obdurate, refused to sign and continued to keep possession
of Antwerp. After fruitless efforts on the part of the great powers
to obtain his acquiescence, France and Great Britain resolved
to have recourse to force. On the 5th of November their combined
fleets sailed for the coast of Holland, and, on the 18th,
<span class="sidenote">The French besiege Antwerp.</span>
a French army of 60,000 men, under the command of
Marshal Gérard, crossed the Belgian frontier to besiege
Antwerp. The Dutch garrison capitulated on the
23rd of December, and on the 31st the town was handed
over to the Belgians, and the French troops withdrew across
the frontier. The Dutch, however, still held two forts, which
enabled them to command the navigation of the Scheldt, and
these they stubbornly refused to yield. Belgium therefore kept
possession of Limburg and Luxemburg, except the fortress of
Luxemburg, which as a fortress of the German confederation was,
under the terms of the treaty of Vienna, garrisoned by Prussian
troops. These territories were treated in every way as a part
of Belgium, and sent representatives to the chambers. Great
<span class="sidenote">The Luxemburg question.</span>
indignation was therefore felt at the idea of giving
them up, when Holland (14th of March 1838) signified
its readiness to accept the conditions of the treaty.
The chambers argued that Belgium had been induced
to agree to the twenty-four articles in 1832 in the hope of thereby
at once terminating all harassing disputes, but as Holland
refused then to accept them, the conditions were no longer
binding and the circumstances were now quite changed. They
urged that Luxemburg in fact formed an integral part of Belgium
and that the people were totally opposed to a union with Holland.
They offered to pay for the territory in dispute, but the treaty
gave them no right of purchase, and the proposal was not entertained.
<span class="sidenote">Final settlement between Holland and Belgium.</span>
Addresses were unanimously voted urging
the king to resist separation, great excitement was
aroused throughout the country and preparations
were made for war. But the firmness of the allied
powers and their determination to uphold the condtions
of the treaty compelled the king most reluctantly
to submit to the inevitable. The treaty was signed in London
on the 19th of April 1839. It saddled Belgium with a portion
of Holland&rsquo;s debt, and a severe financial crisis followed.</p>

<p>The Belgian revolution owed its success to the union of the
Catholic and Liberal parties; and the king had been very careful
to maintain the alliance between them. This continued
to be the character of the government till 1840, but by
<span class="sidenote">Struggle between the Catholics and Liberals.</span>
degrees it had been growing more and more conservative,
and was giving rise to dissatisfaction. A ministry
was formed on more liberal principles, but it clashed
with the Catholic aristocracy, who had the majority in
the senate. A neutral ministry under M. Charles Nothomb was
then formed. In 1842 it carried a new law of primary instruction,
which aroused the dislike of the anti-clerical Liberals. The
Nothomb ministry retired in 1845. In March 1846 the king
formed a purely Catholic ministry, but it was fiercely attacked by
the Liberals, who had for several years been steadily organizing.
A congress was summoned to meet at Brussels (14th of June 1846)
composed of delegates from the different Liberal associations
throughout the country. Three hundred and twenty delegates
met and drew up an Act of Federation and a programme of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page678" id="page678"></a>678</span>
reforms. The election of 1847 gave a majority to the Liberals
and a purely Liberal ministry was formed, and from this date
onwards it has been the constitutional practice in Belgium to
choose a homogeneous ministry from the party which possesses
a working majority in the chamber. In 1848 a new electoral
<span class="sidenote">Electoral reform.</span>
law was passed, which lowered the franchise to 20
florins&rsquo; worth of property and doubled the number of
electors. Hence it came to pass that Belgium passed
safely through the crisis of the French revolution of 1848. The
extreme democratic and socialistic party made with French
aid some spasmodic efforts to stir up a revolutionary movement,
but they met with no popular sympathy; the throne of Leopold
stood firmly based upon the trust and respect of the Belgian
nation for the wisdom and moderation of their king.</p>

<p>The attention of the government was now largely directed to
the stimulating of private industry and the carrying out of
public works of great practical utility, such as the extension of
railways and the opening up of other internal means of communication.
Commercial treaties were also entered into with
various countries with the view of providing additional outlets
for industrial products. The king also sought as much as
possible to remove from the domain of politics every irritating
question, believing that a union of the different parties was most
for the advantage of the state. In 1850 the question of middle-class
education was settled. In 1852 the Liberal cabinet was
overthrown and a ministry of conciliation was formed. A bill
was passed authorizing the army to be raised to 100,000 men
including reserve. The elections of 1854 modified the parliamentary
situation by increasing the strength of the Conservatives;
the ministry resigned and a new one was formed, under
Pierre de Decker, of moderate Catholics and Progressives. In
1857 the government of M. de Decker brought in a bill to establish
&ldquo;the liberty of charity,&rdquo; but in reality to place the administration
of charities in the hands of the priesthood. This led to a violent
agitation throughout the kingdom and the military had to be
called out. Eventually the bill was withdrawn, the ministers
resigned and a Liberal ministry was formed under M. Charles
Rogier. In 1860 the communal <i>octrois</i> or duties on articles of
food brought into the towns was abolished; in 1863 the navigation
of the Scheldt was made free, and a treaty of commerce
established with England. The elections of July 1864 gave a
majority to the Liberals, and M. Rogier continued in office.</p>

<p>On the 10th of December 1865, King Leopold died, after a
reign of thirty-four years. He was greatly beloved by his people,
and to him Belgium owed much, for in difficult circumstances
and critical times he had managed its affairs
<span class="sidenote">Accession of Leopold II.</span>
with great tact and judgment. He was succeeded by
his eldest son Leopold II., who was immediately
proclaimed king and took the oath to the constitution on the
17th of December. On the outbreak of war between France and
Germany in 1870, Belgium saw the difficulty and danger of her
position, and lost no time in providing for contingencies. A
large war credit was voted, the strength of the army was raised
and strong bodies of troops were moved to the frontier. The
feeling of danger to Belgium also caused great excitement in
England. The British government declared its intention to
maintain the integrity of Belgium in accordance with the treaty
of 1839, and it induced the two belligerent powers to agree not
to violate the neutrality of Belgian territory. A considerable
portion of the French army routed at Sedan did indeed seek
refuge across the frontier; but they laid down their arms
according to convention, and were duly &ldquo;interned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1870 the Liberal party, which had been in power for thirteen
years, was overthrown by a union of the Catholics with a
number of Liberal dissentients to whom the policy of the
government had given offence, and a Catholic cabinet, at the
head of which was Baron Jules Joseph d&rsquo;Anethan, took office.
At the election of August 1870, the Catholics obtained a majority
in both chambers. They increased their power considerably
by reducing the voting qualification for electors to provincial
councils to 20 frs., and to communal councils to 10 frs.,
and also by recognizing the importance of what was styled &ldquo;the
Flemish Movement.&rdquo; Hitherto French had been the official
language of the states. The use of Flemish in public documents,
in judicial procedure and in official correspondence was hereafter
<span class="sidenote">The Flemish Movement.</span>
required in the Flemish provinces, and Belgium
became officially bi-lingual. It was, as has been
already pointed out, a reversion to the policy of the
Dutch king, which in 1830 had been so strongly
denounced by the leaders of the Belgian revolution, and its
object was the same, <i>i.e</i>. to prevent <i>frenchification</i> of a population
that was Teutonic by race and speech. In 1871 M. Malou had
become the head of a cabinet of moderate Catholics, and he
retained office till 1878. This was the period of the struggle
between the pope and the Italian government, and the German
<i>Kulturkampf</i>. The Belgian Ultramontanes agitated strongly in
favour of the re-establishment of the temporal power and
against the policy of Bismarck. Though discountenanced by
the ministry, the violence of the Ultra-clericals compassed its
downfall. They passed a law adopting the ballot in 1877, but at
the election of the following year a Liberal majority was returned.</p>

<p>The new cabinet, under M. Frère-Orban, devoted itself solely
to the settlement of the educational system. Hitherto since
1842 in all primary schools instruction by the clergy
in the Catholic faith was obligatory, children belonging
<span class="sidenote">School law of 1879.</span>
to other persuasions being dispensed from attendance.
In 1879 a bill was passed for the secularization of
primary education; but an attempt was made to conciliate the
clergy by Art. 4, which enacted&mdash;&ldquo;religious instruction is relegated
to the care of families and the clergy of the various creeds.
A place in the school may be put at their disposal where the
children may receive religious instruction,&rdquo; at hours other than
those set apart for regular education. The bill likewise provided
for a rigorous inspection of the communal schools. The passing
of this law was met by the clergy by uncompromising resistance.
The bishops ordered that absolution be refused to teachers in the
schools &ldquo;sans Dieu,&rdquo; and to the parents who sent their children
to them, and urged the establishment of private Catholic schools.
All over Belgium the agitation spread, and the clergy, who were
practically independent of state control, gained the victory. In
November 1879 it was calculated that there were but 240,000
scholars in the secularized schools against 370,000 in the Catholic
schools. In Flanders over 80% of the children attended the
Catholic schools. The government appealed to the pope, but
the Holy See declined to take any action, and so great was the
embitterment that the Belgian minister at the Vatican and the
papal nuncio at Brussels were recalled, and in 1880 the clergy
refused to associate themselves with the fêtes of the national
jubilee. In order to emerge victorious in such a struggle the
Liberal party had need of all their strength, but a split took
place between the sections known as the <i>doctrinaires</i> and the
<i>progressists</i>, on the question of an extension of the franchise, and
at the election of 1884 the Catholics carried all before them at the
polls. From 1884 up to the present time the clerical party have
maintained their supremacy.</p>

<p>A Catholic administration under M. Malou at once took in
hand the schools question. A law was passed, despite violent
protests from the Liberals, which enacted that the communes
might maintain the private Catholic schools established since
1879 and suppress unsectarian schools at their pleasure. They
might retain at least one unsectarian or adopt one Catholic school,
where 25 heads of families demanded it. The state subsidized
all the communal schools, Catholic and unsectarian alike. Under
this law in all districts under clerical control the unsectarian
schools were abolished. In October 1884, M. Beernaert replaced
M. Malou as prime minister, and retained that post for the
following ten years. He had in 1886 a troublous and dangerous
situation to deal with. Socialism had become a political force
<span class="sidenote">Social outbreak in 1886.</span>
in the land. Socialism of a German type had taken
deep root among the working men of the Flemish
towns, especially at Ghent and Brussels; socialism of
a French revolutionary type among the Walloon
miners and factory hands. On the 18th of March 1886, a socialist
rising suddenly burst out at Liége, on the occasion of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page679" id="page679"></a>679</span>
anniversary of the Paris Commune, and rapidly spread in other
industrial centres of the Walloon districts. Thousands of workmen
went on strike, demanding better wages and the suffrage.
The ministry acted promptly and with vigour, the outbreak was
suppressed by the employment of the military and order was
restored. But as soon as this was accomplished the government
opened a comprehensive enquiry into the causes of dissatisfaction,
<span class="sidenote">Agitation for a revision of the constitution.</span>
which served as the basis of numerous social laws, and
led eventually to the establishment of universal
suffrage and the substitution in Belgium of a democratic
for a middle-class régime. It was not effected
till several years had been spent in long parliamentary
discussions, by demonstrations on the part of the supporters of
franchise revision and by strikes of a political tendency. At
last the senate and chamber declared, May 1892, that the time
for a revision of certain articles of the constitution had come.
As prescribed by the constitution, a dissolution took place and
two new chambers were elected. The Catholics had a majority
in both, but not enough to enable them to dispense with the
assistance of the Liberals, the constitution requiring for every
revision a two-thirds majority. The bills proposed for extending
the franchise were all rejected (April 11th and 12th). Thereupon
the council of the Labour party proclaimed a general strike.
Fifty thousand workmen struck, in Brussels there were violent
demonstrations, and the agitation assumed generally a dangerous
aspect. Both the government and the opposition in the chambers
saw that delay vas impossible, and that revision must be carried
out. Agreement was reached by the acceptance of a compromise
<span class="sidenote">The Nyssens compromise.</span>
proposed by M. Albert Nyssens, Catholic
deputy and professor of penal procedure and commercial
law at the university of Louvain, and on the
18th of April the chamber adopted an electoral system
until then unknown&mdash;<i>le suffrage universel plural</i>. The citizen in
order to possess a vote for the election of representatives to the
chambers was to be of a <i>minimum</i> age of twenty-five years, and
of thirty years for the election of senators and provincial and
communal councillors. For the four categories of elections a
supplementary vote was given to (<i>a</i>) citizens who having attained
the age of thirty-five years, and being married or widowers with
children, paid at least 5 f. income tax, and (<i>b</i>) to citizens of
the age of twenty-five years possessing real estate to the value of
2000 f. or Belgian state securities yielding an income of at
least 100 f. Two supplementary votes were bestowed upon
citizens having certain educational certificates, or discharging
functions or following professions implying their possession.
This elaborate system was only carried into law after considerable
and violent opposition in the sessions of 1894 and 1895. It was
chiefly the work of the ministry of M. de Burlet, who succeeded
to the place of M. Beernaert in March 1894.</p>

<p>The composition of the elected bodies for the years 1894-1895
was:&mdash;for the chamber of representatives 1,354,891 electors
with 2,085,605 votes, for the senate and provincial
councils 1,148,433 electors with 1,856,838 votes.
<span class="sidenote">Catholic majority of 1894.</span>
The result of the first election in October 1894 was
to give the Catholic party an overwhelming majority.
The old Liberal party almost disappeared, while the Walloon
provinces returned a number of Socialists. In February 1896
M. de Burlet, being in bad health, transferred the direction of
the government to M. Smet de Naeyer. The election of 1894
had given the Liberals a much smaller number of seats than they
ought to have had according to the number of votes they polled,
and a cry arose for the establishment of proportional representation.
Both sides felt that reform was again necessary, but the
Catholic majority disagreed among themselves as to the form
it should take. In 1899 M. Smet de Naeyer gave place as head
of the ministry to M. van den Peereboom. But the proposals
<span class="sidenote">Proportional representation.</span>
of the latter met with organized obstruction on the
part of the Socialist deputies, and after a few months&rsquo;
tenure of office he gave way to M. Smet de Naeyer
once more. The new cabinet at once (August 1899)
introduced a bill giving complete proportional representation
in parliamentary elections to all the arrondissements, and it
was passed despite the defection of a number of Catholic
deputies led by M. Woeste. The election in May 1900 resulted
in the return of a substantial (though reduced) Catholic
majority in both chambers.</p>

<p>During this period of Catholic ascendancy social legislation
was not neglected. Among the enactments the following are
the most important:&mdash;the institution of industrial
and labour councils, composed of employers and
<span class="sidenote">Social legislation.</span>
employés, and of a superior council, formed of officials,
workmen and employers (1887); laws assisting the
erection of workmen&rsquo;s dwellings and supervising the labour
of women and children (1889); laws for ameliorating the system
of Friendly Societies (1890); laws regulating workshops (1896);
conferring corporate rights on trades&rsquo; unions (1898); guaranteeing
the security and health of working men during hours of labour
(1899). In 1900 laws were passed regulating the contract of
labour, placing the workman on a footing of perfect equality
with his employer, assuring the married woman free control of
her savings, and organizing a system of old-age pensions.
Primary education was dealt with in 1895 by a law, which made
religious instruction obligatory, and extended state support to
all schools that satisfied certain conditions. In 1899 there were
in Belgium 6674 subsidized schools, having 775,000 scholars
out of a total of 950,000 children of school age. Only 68,000
did not receive religious instruction. The Catholic party also
strove to mitigate the principle of obligatory military service by
encouraging the system of volunteering and by a reduction
of the time of active service and of the number with the colours.</p>

<p>In 1905 the 75th anniversary of Belgian independence was
celebrated, and there was a great manifestation of loyalty
to King Leopold II. for the wisdom and prudence
shown by him during his long reign. Owing to dissensions
<span class="sidenote">Politics in 1905.</span>
among the Catholic and Conservative party
on the subject of military service and the fortification of Antwerp,
their majority in the chamber in 1904 fell from 26 to 20, that
in the senate from 16 to 12. The partial election in 1906 reduced
the majority in the chamber to 12, while the partial election
in 1908 brought the majority down to 8. The Smet de Naeyer
ministry which had held office since 1900 was defeated in April
1907 in a debate on the mining law over the proposal concerning
the length of the working day. A new cabinet was formed
on the 2nd of May following under the presidency of M. de Trooz,
who had been minister of the interior under M. Smet de Naeyer,
and who retained that portfolio in conjunction with the
premiership. M. de Trooz died on the 31st of December 1907,
and was succeeded by M. Schollaert, president of the chamber.
The count of Flanders, brother of the king, died on the
17th of November 1905, leaving his son Albert heir to the
throne.</p>

<p>The Congo question had meanwhile become an acute one
in Belgium. The personal interest taken by Leopold II. in the
exploration and commercial development of the
equatorial regions of Africa had led, in the creation of
<span class="sidenote">Belgium and the Congo.</span>
the Congo Free State, to results which had originally
not been anticipated. The <i>Comité des Études du Haut
Congo</i>, formed in 1878 at the instance of the king and mainly
financed by him had developed into the International Association
of the Congo, of which a Belgian officer, Colonel M. Strauch, was
president. Through the efforts in Africa of H.M. Stanley a
rudimentary state was created, and through the efforts of King
Leopold in Europe the International Association was recognized
during 1884-1885 by the powers as an independent state.
Declarations to this effect were exchanged between the Belgian
government and the Association on the 23rd of February 1885.
In April of the same year the Belgian chambers authorized the
king to be the chief of the state founded by the Association,
which had already taken the name of <i>État Indépendent du Congo</i>.
The union between Belgium and the new state was declared
to be purely personal, but its European headquarters were in
Brussels, its officials, in the course of time, became almost exclusively
Belgian, and financially and commercially the connexion
between the two countries became increasingly close.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page680" id="page680"></a>680</span>
In 1889 King Leopold announced that he had by his will bequeathed
the Congo state to Belgium, and in 1890 the Belgian
government, in return for financial help, acquired the right of
annexing the country under certain conditions. At later dates
definite proposals for immediate annexation were considered
but not adopted, the king showing a strong disinclination to
cede the state, while among the mass of the Belgians the disinclination
to annex was equally strong. It was not until
terrible reports as to the misgovernment of the Congo created
a strong agitation for reform in Great Britain, America and other
countries responsible for having aided in the creation of the state,
that public opinion in Belgium seriously concerned itself with
the subject. The result was that in November 1907 a new
treaty of cession was presented to the Belgian chambers, while
in March 1908 an additional act modified one of the most objectionable
features of the treaty&mdash;a clause by which the king
retained control of the revenue of a vast territory within the
Congo which he had declared to be his private property. A
colonial law, also submitted to the chambers, secured for Belgium
in case of annexation complete parliamentary control over the
Congo state, and the bill for annexation was finally passed in
September 1908.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">Literature</p>

<p>Belgian literature, taken in the widest sense of the term, falls
into three groups, consisting of works written respectively in
Flemish, Walloon and French. The earlier Flemish authors
are treated under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Dutch Literature</a></span>; the revival of Flemish
Literature (<i>q.v.</i>) since the separation of Belgium from the Netherlands
in 1830, and Walloon Literature (<i>q.v.</i>), are each separately
noticed. The earlier French writers born on what is now Belgian
territory&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> Adenès le Rois, Jean Froissart, Jean Lemaire des
Belges and others&mdash;are included in the general history of French Literature
(<i>q.v.</i>). It remains to consider the literature written
by Belgians in French during the 19th century, and its rapid
development since the revolution of 1831.</p>

<p>Belgian writers were commonly charged with provincialism,
but the prejudice against them has been destroyed by the
brilliant writers of 1870-1880. It was also asserted that Belgian
French literature lacked a national basis, and was merely a
reflection of Parisian models. The most important section of it,
however, has a distinctive quality of its own. Many of its most
distinguished exponents are Flemings by birth, and their writings
reflect the characteristic Flemish scenery; they have the
sensuousness, the colour and the realism of Flemish art; and
on the other hand the tendency to mysticism, to abstraction, is
far removed from the lucidity and definiteness associated with
French literature properly so-called. This profoundly national
character disengaged itself gradually, and has been more strikingly
evident since 1870. The earlier writers of the century
were content to follow French tradition.</p>

<p>The events of 1830-1831 gave a great stimulus to Belgian
letters, but the country possessed writers of considerable merit
before that date. Adolphe Mathieu (1802-1876) belongs to the
earlier half of the century, although the tenth and last volume
of his <i>&OElig;uvres en vers</i> was only printed in 1870. His later works
show the influence of the Romantic revival. Auguste Clavareau
(1787-1864), a mediocre poet, an imitator of the French and
Dutch, produced some successful comedies, but he ceased to
write plays before 1830. Édouard Smits (1789-1852) showed
romantic tendencies in his tragedies of <i>Marie de Bourgogne</i> (1823),
<i>Elfrida</i> (1825), and <i>Jeanne de Flandre</i> (1828). The first of these
had a great success, partly no doubt because of its patriotic
subject. For four years before 1830 André van Hasselt (<i>q.v.</i>)
had been publishing his verses in the <i>Sentinelle des Pays-Bas</i>,
and from 1829 onwards he was an ardent romanticist. A burst
of literary and artistic activity followed the Revolution; and
van Hasselt&rsquo;s house became a centre of poets, artists and
musicians of the romantic school. The best work of the Belgian
romanticists is in the rich and picturesque prose of the 16th
century romance of Charles de Coster (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">De Coster</a></span>), and in
the melancholy and semi-philosophical writings of the moralist
Octave Pirmez (<i>q.v.</i>). The <i>Poésies</i> (1841) and the <i>Chansons</i>
(1866) of Antoine Clesse (1816-1889), have been compared with
the work of Béranger; and the Catholic party found a champion
against the liberals and revolutionists in the satirical poet, Benoît
Quinet (b. 1819). Among the famous dramatic pieces of this
epoch was the <i>André Chénier</i> (1843) of Édouard Wacken (1819-1861),
who was a lyric rather than a dramatic poet; also the
comedies of Louis Labarre (1810-1892) and of Henri Delmotte
(1822-1884). Charles Potvin (1818-1902), a poet and a dramatist,
is best known by a patriotic <i>Histoire des lettres en Belgique</i>,
forming vol. iv. of the Belgian compilation, <i>Cinquante ans de
liberté</i> (1882), and by his essays in literary history. Eugène van
Bemmel (1824-1880) established an excellent historical tradition
in his <i>Histoire de la Belgique</i> (1880), reproducing textually the
original authorities, and also edited a Belgian Encyclopaedia
(1873-1875), the <i>Patria Belgica</i>. Baron E.C. de Gerlache (1785-1871)
wrote the history of the Netherlands from the ultramontane
standpoint. The romanticists were attacked in an amusing
satire, <i>Les Voyages et aventures de M. Alfred Nicolas</i> (1835), by
François Grandgagnage (1797-1877), who was a nationalist in
the narrowest sense, and regarded the movement as an indefensible
invasion of foreign ideas. The best of the novelists of
this period, excluding Charles de Coster, was perhaps Estelle
Ruelens (<i>née</i> Crèvec&oelig;ur; 1821-1878); she wrote under the
pseudonym of &ldquo;Caroline Gravière.&rdquo; Her tales were collected by
the bibliophile &ldquo;P.L. Jacob&rdquo; (Paris, 1873-1874).</p>

<p>The whole of this literature derived more or less from foreign
sources, and, with the exception of Charles de Coster and Octave
Pirmez, produced no striking figures. De Coster died in 1879,
and Pirmez in 1883, and the new movement in Belgian literature
dates from the banquet given in the latter year to Camille
Lemonnier (<i>q.v.</i>) whose powerful personality did much to turn
&ldquo;Young Belgium&rdquo; into a national channel. Lemonnier himself
cannot be exclusively claimed by any of the conflicting schools of
young writers. He was by turns naturalist, lyrist and symbolist;
and it has been claimed that the germs of all the later developments
in Belgian letters may be traced in his work. The quinquennial
prize of literature had been refused to his <i>Un mâle</i>, and
the younger generation of artists and men of letters gave him a
banquet which was recognized as a protest against the official
literature, represented by Louis Hymans (1829-1884), Gustave
Frédérix (b. 1834), the literary critic of <i>L&rsquo;Indépendance belge</i>,
and others. The centres around which the young writers were
grouped were two reviews, <i>L&rsquo;Art moderne</i> and <i>La Jeune Belgique</i>.
<i>L&rsquo;Art moderne</i> was founded in 1882 by Edmond Picard, who had
as his chief supporters Victor Arnould and Octave Maus. The
first editor of <i>La Jeune Belgique</i> was M. Warlomont (1860-1889),
known under the pen-name of &ldquo;Max Waller.&rdquo; This review,
which owed much of its success to Waller&rsquo;s energy, defended the
intense preoccupation of the new writers with questions of style,
and became the depository of the Parnassian tradition in Belgium.
It had among its early contributors Georges Eekhoud, Albert
Giraud, Iwan Gilkin and Georges Rodenbach. Edmond Picard
(b. 1836) was one of the foremost in the battle. He was well
known as an advocate in Brussels, and made a considerable
contribution to jurisprudence as the chief writer of the <i>Pandectes
belges</i> (1886-1890). His <i>Pro arte</i> (1886) was a kind of literary
code for the young Belgian writers. His novels, of which <i>La
Forge Roussel</i> (1881) is a good example, were succeeded in 1902-1903
by two plays, <i>Jéricho</i> and <i>Fatigue de vivre</i>.</p>

<p>Georges Eekhoud, born at Antwerp on the 27th of May 1854,
was in some ways the most passionately Flemish of the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page681" id="page681"></a>681</span>
group. He described the life of the peasants of his native Flanders
with a bold realism, making himself the apologist of the vagabond
and the outcast in a series of tragic stories:&mdash;<i>Kees Doorik</i> (1883),
<i>Kermesses</i> (1883), <i>Nouvelles Kermesses</i> (1887),
<i>Le Cycle patibulaire</i> (1892), <i>Mes Communions</i> (1895), <i>Escal Vigor</i>
(1899) and <i>La Faneuse d&rsquo;amour</i> (1900), &amp;c. <i>Nouvelle Carthage</i>
(1888) deals with modern Antwerp. In 1892 he produced a
striking book on English literature entitled <i>Au siècle de Shakespeare</i>,
and has written French versions of Beaumont and Fletcher&rsquo;s
<i>Philaster</i> (1895) and of Marlow&rsquo;s <i>Edward II.</i>  (1896).</p>

<p>The earlier work of &ldquo;Young Belgium&rdquo; in poetry was experimental
in character, and was marked by extravagances of style
and a general exuberance which provoked much hostile criticism.
The young writers of 1870 to 1880 had not long to wait, however,
for recognition both at home and in Paris, where many of them
found hospitality in the pages of the <i>Mercure de France</i> from
1890 onwards. They divided their allegiance between the
leaders of the French Parnassus and the Symbolists.</p>

<p>The most powerful of the Belgian poets, Émile Verhaeren (<i>q.v.</i>),
is the most daring in his technical methods of expressing bizarre
sensation, and has been called the &ldquo;poet of paroxysm.&rdquo; His
reputation extends far beyond the limits of his own country.</p>

<p>Many of the Belgian poets adhere to the classical form.
Albert Giraud (born at Louvain in 1860) was faithful to the
Parnassian tradition in his <i>Pierrot lunaire</i> (1884), <i>Pierrot narcisse</i>
(1891) and <i>Hors du siècle</i> (1886). In the earlier works of Iwan
Gilkin (born at Brussels in 1858) the influence of Charles Baudelaire
is predominant. He wrote <i>Damnation de l&rsquo;artiste</i> (1890),
<i>Ténèbres</i> (1892), <i>Stances dorées</i> (1893), <i>La Nuit</i> (1897) and
<i>Prométhée</i> (1899). The poems of Valère Gille (born at Brussels
in 1867), whose <i>Cithare</i> was crowned by the French Academy in
1898, belong to the same group. Émile van Arenberghe (born
at Louvain in 1854) is the author of some exquisite sonnets.
Fernand Severin (b. 1867) in his <i>Poèmes ingénus</i> (1900) aims at
simplicity of form, and seems to have learnt the art of his
musical verse direct from Racine. With Severin is closely associated
Georges Marlow (b. 1872), author of <i>L&rsquo;Âme en exil</i> (1895).</p>

<p>Georges Rodenbach (1855-1898) spent most of his life in
Paris and was an intimate of Edmond de Goncourt. He produced
some Parisian and purely imitative work; but the best part of
his production is the outcome of a passionate idealism of the
quiet Flemish towns in which he had passed his childhood and
early youth. In his best known work, <i>Bruges la Morte</i> (1892), he
explains that his aim is to evoke the town as a living being,
associated with the moods of the spirit, counselling, dissuading
from and prompting action.</p>

<p>The most famous of all modern Belgian writers, Maurice
Maeterlinck (<i>q.v.</i>), made his début in a Parisian journal, the
<i>Pléiade</i>, in 1886. He succeeded more nearly than any of his
predecessors in expressing or suggesting ideas and emotions
which might have been supposed to be capable of translation
only in terms of music. &ldquo;The unconscious self, or rather the
sub-conscious self,&rdquo; says Émile Verhaeren, &ldquo;recognized in the
verse and prose of Maeterlinck its language or rather its stammering
attempt at language.&rdquo; Maeterlinck was a native of Ghent,
and the first poems of two of his fellow-townsmen also appeared
in the <i>Pléiade</i>. These were Grégoire le Roy (b. 1862), author
of <i>La Chanson d&rsquo;un soir</i> (1886), and <i>Mon C&oelig;ur pleure d&rsquo;autrefois</i>
(1889); and Charles van Lerberghe (b. 1861), author of a play,
<i>Les Flaireurs</i> (1890) and a collection of <i>Poèmes</i> (1897).</p>

<p>Max Elskamp (born at Antwerp in 1862) is the author of some
volumes of religious poetry&mdash;<i>Dominical</i> (1892), <i>Salutations, dont
d&rsquo;angéliques</i> (1893), <i>En symbole vers l&rsquo;apostolat</i> (1895)&mdash;for which
he has devised as background an imaginary city. Eugène
Demolder (b.1862) also created a mythical city as a setting for
his prose <i>contes</i> in the <i>Légende d&rsquo;Yperdamme</i> (1897).</p>

<p>Belgian literary activity extends also to historical research.
Baron Kervyn de Lettenhove (1817-1891) wrote a <i>Histoire de
Flandre</i> (7 vols., 1847-1855), and a number of monographs
on separate points in Flemish and English history. Though an
accurate historian, he allowed himself lo be prejudiced by his
extreme Catholic views. He was a vehement defender of
Mary Stuart. Louis Gachard (1800-1885) wrote many valuable
works on 16th century history; Mgr. Namèche (1810-1893)
completed the 29th volume of his <i>Cours d&rsquo;histoire nationale</i>
before his death; Charles Piot (b. 1812) edited the correspondence
of Cardinal de Granvelle; Alphonse Wauters (1818-1898),
archivist of Brussels, published many archaeological works; and
Charles Rahlenbeck (1823-1903) wrote enthusiastically of the
history of Protestantism in Belgium. One of the most masterly
writers of French in Belgium was the economist Émile de
Laveleye (<i>q.v.</i>). In aesthetics should be noted the historian
of music, François Joseph Fétis (1784-1871); F.A. Gevaert
(1828-1908), author of <i>Histoire et théorie de la musique d&rsquo;antiquité</i>
(2 vols., 1875-1881); and Victor Mahillon (b. 1841) for his
work in acoustics and his descriptive catalogue (1893-1900)
of the museum of musical instruments belonging to the Brussels
conservatoire. In psychology Joseph Delboeuf (1831-1896)
enjoyed a great reputation outside Belgium; Elisée Reclus
(b. 1830), though a Frenchman by birth, completed his <i>Géographie
universelle</i> (1875-1894) in exile at Brussels; and Ernest Nys
has written many standard works on international law. In the
history of literature an important work is compiled by Ferdinand
van der Haeghen and others in the <i>Bibliotheca Belgica</i> (1880, &amp;c.),
comprising a description of all the books printed in the Netherlands
in the 15th and 16th centuries. The vicomte de Spoelberch
de Lovenjoul (1836-1907) was well known in France as the
author of <i>Sainte-Beuve inconnu</i> (1901), <i>La Genèse d&rsquo;un roman
de Balzac</i> (1901), <i>Une Page perdue de H. de Balzac</i> (1903), and
of numerous bibliographical works.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELGRADE<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> (Servian, <i>Biograd</i> or <i>Beograd</i>, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;White Castle&rdquo;),
the capital of Servia. Pop. (1900) 69,097. Belgrade occupies a triangular
ridge or foreland, washed on the north-west by the Save,
and on the north-east by the Danube; these rivers flowing respectively
from the south-west and north-west. The sides of the
triangle slope down abruptly towards the west, more gradually
towards the east; at the base stands the cone of Avala Hill,
the last outpost of the Rudnik Mountains, which extend far
away to the south; and, at the apex, a cliff of Tertiary chalk,
200 ft. high, overlooks the confluence of the two rivers, the large,
flat island of Veliki Voyn and several smaller islets. This cliff
is crowned by the walls and towers of the citadel, once white,
but now maroon with age, and, though useful as a prison and
barracks, no longer of any military value. Behind the citadel,
and along its <i>glacis</i> on the southern side, are the gardens of
Kalemegdan, commanding a famous view across the river;
behind Kalemegdan comes Belgrade itself, a city of white
houses, among which a few great public buildings, like the high
school, national bank, national theatre and the so-called
New Palace, stand forth prominently. The town was formerly
divided into three parts, namely, the Old town, the Russian town
(<i>Sava-Makhala</i> or Save district), and the Turkish town (<i>Dor&#269;ol</i>, or
Cross-road). A great change, however, took place in the course of
the 19th century, and the old divisions are only partially applicable,
while there has to be added the Tirazia, an important suburban
extension along the line of the aqueduct or <i>Tirazi</i>. A few old
Turkish houses, built of plaster, with red-tiled roofs, are left
among the ill-paved and insanitary districts bordering upon
the rivers, but as the royal residence, the seat of government,
and the centre of the import trade, Belgrade was, after 1869,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page682" id="page682"></a>682</span>
rapidly transformed into a modern European town, with wide
streets, electric tramways and electric lighting. Only the
multitude of small gardens, planted with limes, acacias and lilacs,
and the bright costumes of the Servian or Hungarian peasants,
remain to distinguish it from a western capital. For a town of
such importance, which is also the seat of the metropolitan of
Servia, Belgrade has very few churches, and these are of a
somewhat modest type. There were, in 1900, four Servian
Orthodox churches, including the cathedral, one Roman Catholic
chapel, one Evangelical chapel (German), two synagogues and
one mosque. This last is kept up entirely at the expense of the
Servian government.</p>

<p>The highest educational establishments are to be found in
Belgrade: the <i>Velika Shkola</i> (a small university with three
faculties), the military academy, the theological seminary, the
high school for girls, a commercial academy, and several schools
for secondary education on German models. A commercial
tribunal, a court of appeal and the court of cassation are also
in Belgrade. There is a fine monument to Prince Michael (1860-1868)
who succeeded in removing the Turkish garrison from
the Belgrade citadel and obtaining other Turkish fortresses in
Servia by skilful diplomacy. There are also an interesting
national museum, with Roman antiquities and numismatic
collections, a national library with a wealth of old Servian MSS.
among its 40,000 volumes, and a botanical garden, rich in
specimens of the Balkan flora. To promote commerce there are a
stock and produce exchange (<i>Berza</i>), a national bank, privileged
to issue notes, and several other banking establishments. The
insurance work is done by foreign companies.</p>

<p>The bulk of the foreign trade of Servia passes through Belgrade,
but the industrial output of the city itself is not large, owing to
the scarcity both of labour and capital. The principal industries
are brewing, iron-founding and the manufacture of cloth, boots,
leather, cigarettes, matches, pottery, preserved meat and
confectionery. The railway from Budapest to Constantinople
crosses the Save by a fine bridge on the south-west, above the
landing-place for steamers. Farther south is the park of <i>Topchider</i>,
with an old Turkish kiosk built for Prince Milosh (1818-1839)
in the beautifully laid-out grounds. In the adjoining
forest of lime-trees, called <i>Koshutnyak</i> or the &ldquo;deer-park,&rdquo;
Prince Michael was assassinated in 1868. Just opposite the
citadel, in a north-westerly direction, half-an-hour by steamer
across the Danube, lies the Hungarian town of Semlin. For
administrative purposes, Belgrade forms a separate department
of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The first fortification of the rock, at the confluence of the
Save and the Danube, was made by the Celts in the 3rd century
<span class="scs">B.C.</span> They gave it the name of <i>Singidunum</i>, by which Belgrade
was known until the 7th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> The Romans took it
from the Celts, and replaced their fort by a regular Roman
<i>castrum</i>, placing in it a strong garrison. Roman bricks, dug
up in the fortress, bear the inscription, <i>Legio IV. Flavia Felix</i>.
From the 4th to the beginning of the 6th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> it often
changed its masters (Huns, Sarmatians, Goths, Gepids); then
the emperor Justinian brought it once more under Roman rule
and fortified and embellished it. Towards the end of the 8th
century it was taken by the Franks of Charlemagne. In the 9th
century it was captured by the Bulgarians, and held by them
until the beginning of the 11th century, when the Byzantine
emperor Basil II. reconquered it for the Greek empire. The
Hungarians, under king Stephen, took it from the Greeks in
1124. From that time it was constantly changing hands&mdash;Greeks,
Bulgarians, Hungarians, replacing each other in turn.
The city was considered to be the key of Hungary, and its
possession was believed to secure possession of Servia, besides
giving command of the traffic between the Upper and the Lower
Danube. It has, in consequence, seen more battles under its
walls than most fortresses in Europe. The Turks used to call
it <i>Darol-i-Jehad</i>, &ldquo;the home of wars for faith.&rdquo; During the
14th century it was in the hands of the Servian kings. The
Servian prince George Brankovich ceded it to the Hungarians in
1427. The Turkish forces unsuccessfully besieged the city
in 1444 and 1456, on which last occasion a glorious victory was
obtained by the Christian garrison, led by the famous John
Hunyady and the enthusiastic monk John Capistran. In 1521
Sultan Suleiman took it from the Hungarians, and from that
year it remained in Turkish possession until 1688, when the
Austrians captured it, only to lose it again in 1690. In 1717
Prince Eugene of Savoy conquered it for Austria, which kept
it until 1739, improving the fortifications and giving great
impulse to the commercial development of the town. From
1739 to 1789 the Turks were again its masters, when, in that
last year, the Austrians under General Laudon carried it by
assault, only to lose it again in 1792. In 1807 the Servians,
having risen for their independence, forced the Turkish garrison
to capitulate, and became masters of Belgrade, which they kept
until the end of September 1813, when they abandoned it to the
Turks. Up to the year 1862 not only was the fortress of Belgrade
garrisoned by Turkish troops, but the Danubian slope of the town
was inhabited by Turks, living under a special Turkish
administration, while the modern part of the town (the plateau
of the ridge and the western slope) was inhabited by Servians
living under their own authorities. This dual government was
a constant cause of friction between the Servians and the Turks,
and on the occasion of one conflict between the two parties
the Turkish commander of the fortress bombarded the Servian
part of the town (June 1862). The indirect consequence of

<p><span class="bold">BELHAVEN AND STENTON, JOHN HAMILTON,<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> <span class="sc">2nd Baron</span>
(1656-1708), was the eldest son of Robert Hamilton, Lord
Presmennan (d. 1696), and was born on the 5th of July 1656.
Having married Margaret, granddaughter of John Hamilton,
1st Baron Belhaven and Stenton, who had been made a peer by
Charles I. in 1647, he succeeded to this title in 1679. In 1681
he was imprisoned for opposing the government and for speaking
slightingly of James, duke of York, afterwards James II., in
parliament, and in 1689 he was among those who asked William
of Orange to undertake the government of Scotland. Belhaven
was at the battle of Killiecrankie; he was a member of the
Scottish privy council, and he was a director of the Scottish
Trading Company, which was formed in 1695 and was responsible
for the Darien expedition. He favoured the agitation for
securing greater liberty for his country, an agitation which
culminated in the passing of the Act of Security in 1705, and he
greatly disliked the union of the parliaments, a speech which he
delivered against this proposal in November 1706 attracting
much notice and a certain amount of ridicule. Later he was
imprisoned, ostensibly for favouring a projected French invasion,
and he died in London on the 21st of June 1708. Belhaven is
chiefly famous as an orator, and two of his speeches, one of them
the famous one of November 1706, were printed by D. Defoe in
an appendix to his <i>History of the Union</i> (1786).</p>

<p>Belhaven&rsquo;s son, John, who fought on the English side at
Sheriffmuir, became the 3rd baron on his father&rsquo;s death. He
was drowned in November 1721, whilst proceeding to take up
his duties as governor of Barbados, and was succeeded by his
son John (d. 1764). After the death of John&rsquo;s brother James in
1777 the title was for a time dormant; then in 1799 the House
of Lords declared that William Hamilton (1765-1814), a
descendant of John Hamilton, the paternal great-grandfather
of the 2nd baron, was entitled to the dignity. William, who
became the 7th baron, was succeeded by his son Robert (1793-1868),
who was created a peer of the United Kingdom as Baron
Hamilton of Wishaw in 1831. He died without issue in December
1868, when the barony of Hamilton became extinct; in 1875
the House of Lords declared that his cousin, James Hamilton
(1822-1893) was rightfully Baron Belhaven and Stenton, and
the title descended to his kinsman, Alexander Charles (b. 1840),
the 10th baron.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELISARIUS<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 505-565), one of the most famous generals of
the later Roman empire, was born about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 505, in &ldquo;Germania,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page683" id="page683"></a>683</span>
a district on the borders of Thrace and Macedonia. His name is
supposed to be Slavonic. As a youth he served in the bodyguard
of Justinian, who appointed him commander of the
Eastern army. He won a signal victory over the Persians in
530, and successfully conducted a campaign against them, until
forced, by the rashness of his soldiers, to join battle and suffer
defeat in the following year. Recalled to Constantinople, he
married Antonina, a clever, intriguing woman, and a favourite of
the empress Theodora. During the sedition of the &ldquo;green&rdquo;
and &ldquo;blue&rdquo; parties of the circus (known as the Nika sedition,
532) he did Justinian good service, effectually crushing the rebels
who had proclaimed Hypatius emperor. In 533 the command
of the expedition against the Vandal kingdom in Africa, a
perilous office, which the rest of the imperial generals shunned,
was conferred on Belisarius. With 15,000 mercenaries, whom he
had to train into Roman discipline, he took Carthage, defeated
Gelimer the Vandal king, and carried him captive, in 534, to
grace the first triumph witnessed in Constantinople. In reward
for these services Belisarius was invested with the consular
dignity, and medals were struck in his honour. At this time the
Ostrogothic kingdom, founded in Italy by Theodoric the Great,
was shaken by internal dissensions, of which Justinian resolved
to avail himself. Accordingly, Belisarius invaded Sicily; and,
after storming Naples and defending Rome for a year against
almost the entire strength of the Goths in Italy, he concluded
the war by the capture of Ravenna, and with it of the Gothic
king Vitiges. So conspicuous were Belisarius&rsquo;s heroism and
military skill that the Ostrogoths offered to acknowledge him
emperor of the West. But his loyalty did not waver; he
rejected the proposal and returned to Constantinople in 540.
Next year he was sent to check the Persian king Chosroes (Anushirvan);
but, thwarted by the turbulence of his troops, he
achieved no decisive result. On his return to Constantinople he
lived under a cloud for some time, but was pardoned through
the influence Of Antonina with the empress. The Goths having
meanwhile reconquered Italy, Belisarius was despatched with
utterly inadequate forces to oppose them. Nevertheless, during
five campaigns he held his enemies at bay, until he was removed
from the command, and the conclusion of the war was entrusted
to the eunuch Narses. Belisarius remained at Constantinople
in tranquil retirement until 559, when an incursion of Bulgarian
savages spread a panic through the metropolis, and men&rsquo;s eyes
were once more turned towards the neglected veteran, who
placed himself at the head of a mixed multitude of peasants and
soldiers, and repelled the barbarians with his wonted courage
and adroitness. But this, like his former victories, stimulated
Justinian&rsquo;s envy. The saviour of his country was coldly received
and left unrewarded by his suspicious sovereign. Shortly afterwards
Belisarius was accused of complicity in a conspiracy
against the emperor (562); his fortune was confiscated, and he
was confined as a prisoner in his palace. He was liberated and
restored to favour in 563, and died in 565.</p>

<p>The fiction of Belisarius wandering as a blind beggar through
the streets of Constantinople, which has been adopted by
Marmontel in his <i>Bélisaire</i>, and by various painters and poets,
is first heard of in the 10th century. Gibbon justly calls Belisarius
the Africanus of New Rome. He was merciful as a
conqueror, stern as a disciplinarian, enterprising and wary as a
general; while his courage, loyalty and forbearance seem to
have been almost unsullied. He was the idol of his soldiers, a
good tactician, but not a great strategist.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELIT<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> (signifying the &ldquo;lady,&rdquo; <i>par excellence</i>), in the Babylonian
religion, the designation of the consort of Bel (<i>q.v.</i>). Her
real name was Nin-lil, <i>i.e.</i> the &ldquo;lady of power,&rdquo; if the explanation
suggested in <span class="sc">Bel</span> for the second element is correct. She is also
designated as Nin-Khar-sag, &ldquo;Lady of the mountain,&rdquo; which
name stands in some relationship to Im-Khar-sag, &ldquo;storm
mountain&rdquo;&mdash;the name of the staged tower or sacred edifice to
Bel at Nippur. As the consort of En-lil, the goddess Nin-lil or
Belit belongs to Nippur and her titles as &ldquo;ruler of heaven and
earth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;mother of the gods&rdquo; are all due to her position
as the wife of Bel. While recognized by a temple of her own in
Nippur and honoured by rulers at various times by having votive
offerings made in her honour and fortresses dedicated in her
name, she, as all other goddesses in Babylonia and Assyria with
the single exception of Ishtar, is overshadowed by her male
consort. The title Belit was naturally transferred to the great mother-goddess
Ishtar after the decline of the cult at Nippur,
and we also find the consort of Marduk, known as Sarpanit,
designated as Belit, for the sufficient reason that Marduk, after
the rise of the city of Babylon as the seat of his cult, becomes the
Bel or &ldquo;lord&rdquo; of later days.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELIZE,<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Balize</span>, the capital and principal seaport of
British Honduras, on the Caribbean Sea, in 17° 29&prime; N. and
88° 11&prime; W. Pop. (1904) 9969. Belize occupies both banks of
the river Belize, at its mouth. Its houses are generally built of
wood, with high roofs and wide verandahs shaded by cocoanut
or cabbage palms. The principal buildings are the court house,
in the centre of the town, government house, at the southern
end, Fort George, towards the north, the British bank of
Honduras, the hospital, the Roman Catholic convent, and the
Wesleyan church, which is the largest and handsomest of all.
Mangrove swamps surround the town and epidemics of cholera,
yellow fever and other tropical diseases have been frequent;
but the unhealthiness of the climate is mitigated to some extent
by the high tides which cover the marshes, and the invigorating
breezes which blow in from the sea. Belize is connected by
telegraph and telephone with the other chief towns of British
Honduras, but there is no railway, and communication even by
road is defective. The exports are mahogany, rosewood, cedar,
logwood and other cabinet-woods and dye-woods, with cocoanuts,
sugar, sarsaparilla, tortoiseshell, deerskins, turtles and fruit,
especially bananas. Breadstuffs, cotton fabrics and hardware
are imported.</p>

<p>Belize probably derives its name from the French <i>balise</i>,
&ldquo;a beacon,&rdquo; as no doubt some signal or light was raised here
for the guidance of the buccaneers who once infested this region.
Local tradition connects the name with that of Wallis or Wallace,
a Scottish buccaneer, who, in 1638, settled, with a party of
logwood cutters, on St George&rsquo;s Cay, a small island off the town.
In the 18th century the names Wallis and Belize were used
interchangeably for the town, the river and the whole country.
The history of Belize is inextricably bound up with that of the
rest of British Honduras (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

He spent part of his childhood in England and was a frequent
visitor in London. His lectures on English literature at the
Sorbonne, where a chair was created expressly for him, did much
to promote the study of English in France. In 1905-1906 he
was Clark lecturer on English literature at Trinity College,
Cambridge. He died at Domont (Seine-et-Oise) on the 19th of
September 1906. His best known book was a masterly study

illustrated by the lives of Dryden, Addison and Pope. This
book, <i>Le Public et les hommes de lettres en Angleterre au XVIII<span class="sp">e</span>

<p><span class="bold">BELL, ANDREW<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> (1753-1832), British divine and educationalist,
was born at St Andrews on the 27th of March 1753. He
graduated at the university there, and afterwards spent some
years as a tutor in Virginia, U.S.A. On his return he took orders,
and in 1787 sailed for India, where he held eight army chaplaincies
at the same time. In 1789 he became superintendent
of the male orphan asylum at Madras, and having been obliged
from scarcity of teachers to introduce the system of mutual
tuition by the pupils, found the scheme answer so well that he
became convinced of its universal applicability. In 1797, after
his return to London, he published a small pamphlet explaining
his views on education. Little public attention was drawn
towards the &ldquo;monitorial&rdquo; plan till Joseph Lancaster (<i>q.v</i>.), the
Quaker, opened a school in Southwark, conducting it in accordance
with Bell&rsquo;s principles, and improving on his system. The
success of the method, and the strong support given to Lancaster
by the whole body of Nonconformists gave immense impetus to
the movement. Similar schools were established in great
numbers; and the members of the Church of England, becoming
alarmed at the patronage of such schools resting entirely in the
hands of dissenters, resolved to set up similar institutions in
which their own principles should be inculcated. In 1807 Bell
was called from his rectory of Swanage in Dorset to organize a
system of schools in accordance with these views, and in 1811
became superintendent of the newly formed &ldquo;National Society
for Promoting the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the
Established Church.&rdquo; For his valuable services he was in some
degree recompensed by his preferment to a prebend of Westminster,
and to the mastership of Sherburn hospital, Durham.
He tried, but without success, to plant his system in Scotland
and on the continent. He died on the 27th of January 1832, at
Cheltenham, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. His great
fortune was bequeathed almost entirely for educational purposes.
Of the £120,000 given in trust to the provost of St Andrews, two
city ministers and the professor of Greek in the university, half
was devoted to the founding of the important school, called the
Madras College, at St Andrews; £10,000 was left to each of the
large cities, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leith, Inverness and Aberdeen,
for school purposes; and £10,000 was also given to the Royal

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BELL, SIR CHARLES<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> (1774-1842), Scottish anatomist, was
born at Edinburgh in November 1774, the youngest son of the
Rev. William Bell, a clergyman of the Episcopal Church of
Scotland; among his brothers were the anatomist, John Bell,
and the jurist, G.J. Bell. After attending the high school and
the university of Edinburgh, he embraced the profession of
medicine, and devoted himself chiefly to the study of anatomy,
under the direction of his brother John. His first work, entitled
<i>A System of Dissections, explaining the anatomy of the human
body, the manner of displaying the parts, and their varieties in
disease</i>, was published in Edinburgh in 1798, while he was still
a pupil, and for many years was considered to be a valuable
guide to the student of practical anatomy. In 1802 he published
a series of engravings of original drawings, showing the anatomy
of the brain and nervous system. These drawings, which are
remarkable for artistic skill and finish, were taken from dissections
made by Bell for the lectures or demonstrations he gave
on the nervous system as part of the course of anatomical
instruction of his brother. In 1804 he wrote the third volume,
containing the anatomy of the nervous system and of the organs
of special sense, of <i>The Anatomy of the Human Body</i>, by John
and Charles Bell. In November of the same year he migrated
to London, and from that date, for nearly forty years, he kept up
a regular correspondence with his brother George, much of which
was published in the <i>Letters of Sir Charles Bell</i>, &amp;c., 1870.
The earlier letters of this correspondence show how rapidly he rose
to distinction in a field where success was difficult, as it was
already occupied by such men as John Abernethy, Sir Astley
Cooper and Henry Cline. Before leaving Edinburgh, he had
written his work on the <i>Anatomy of Expression</i>, which was
published in London soon after his arrival and at once attracted
attention. His practical knowledge of anatomy and his skill as an
artist qualified him in an exceptional manner for such a work.
The object of this treatise was to describe the arrangements by
which the influence of the mind is propagated to the muscular
frame, and to give a rational explanation of the muscular movements
which usually accompany the various emotions and
passions. One special feature was the importance attributed
to the respiratory arrangements as a source of expression, and it
was shown how the physician and surgeon might derive information
regarding the nature and extent of important diseases by
observing the expression of bodily suffering. This work, apart
from its value to artists and psychologists, is of interest historically,
as there is no doubt the investigations of the author into the
nervous supply of the muscles of expression induced him to
prosecute inquiries which led to his great discoveries in the
physiology of the nervous system.</p>

<p>In 1811 Bell published his <i>New Idea of the Anatomy of the Brain</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page685" id="page685"></a>685</span>
in which he announced the discovery of the different functions
of the nerves corresponding with their relations to different
parts of the brain; his latest researches were described in <i>The
Nervous System of the Human Body</i> (1830), a collection of papers
read by him before the Royal Society. He discovered that in the
nervous trunks there are special sensory filaments, the office
of which is to transmit impressions from the periphery of the
body to the sensorium, and special motor filaments which convey
motor impressions from the brain or other nerve centre to the
muscles. He also showed that some nerves consist entirely of
sensory filaments and are therefore sensory nerves, that others
are composed of motor filaments and are therefore motor nerves,
whilst a third variety contains both kinds of filaments and are
therefore to be regarded as sensory-motor. Furthermore, he
indicated that the brain and spinal cord may be divided into
separate parts, each part having a special function&mdash;one part
ministering to motion, the other to sensation, and that the origin
of the nerves from one or other or both of those sources endows
them with the peculiar property of the division whence they
spring. He also demonstrated that no motor nerve ever passes
through a ganglion. Lastly, he showed, both from theoretical
considerations and from the result of actual experiment on the
living animal, that the anterior roots of the spinal nerves are
<i>motor</i>, while the posterior are <i>sensory</i>. These discoveries as a
whole must be regarded as the greatest in physiology since that
of the circulation of the blood by William Harvey. They were
not only a distinct and definite advance in scientific knowledge,
but from them flowed many practical results of much importance
in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. It is not surprising
that Bell should have viewed his results with exultation. On
the 26th of November 1807, he wrote to his brother George:&mdash;&ldquo;I
have done a more interesting <i>nova anatomia cerebri humani</i>
than it is possible to conceive. I lectured it yesterday. I
prosecuted it last night till one o&rsquo;clock; and I am sure it will
be well received.&rdquo; On the 31st of the same month he wrote:&mdash;&ldquo;I
really think this new anatomy of the brain will strike more
than the discovery of the lymphatics being absorbents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1807 he produced a <i>System of Comparative Surgery</i>, in which
surgery is regarded almost wholly from an anatomical and
operative point of view, and there is little or no mention of the
use of medicinal substances. It placed him, however, in the
highest rank of English writers on surgery. In 1809 he relinquished
his professional work in London, and rendered
meritorious services to the wounded from Coruña, who were
brought to the Haslar hospital at Portsmouth. In 1810 he published
a series of <i>Letters concerning the Diseases of the Urethra</i>,
in which he treated of stricture from an anatomical and pathological
point of view. In 1812 he was appointed surgeon to the
Middlesex hospital, a post he retained for twenty-four years.
He was also professor of anatomy, physiology and surgery to
the College of Surgeons of London, and for many years teacher
of anatomy in the school which used to exist in Great Windmill
Street. In 1815 he went to Brussels to treat the wounded of
the battle of Waterloo. In 1816, 1817 and 1818, he published
a series of <i>Quarterly Reports of Cases in Surgery</i>;
in 1821 a volume of coloured plates with descriptive
letterpress, entitled <i>Illustrations
of the great operations of Surgery, Trepan, Hernia, Amputation
and Lithotomy</i>, and in 1824 <i>Observations on Injuries of the
Spine and of the Thigh Bone</i>. On the formation of University
College, Gower Street, he was for a short time head of the
medical department. In 1832 he wrote a paper for the Royal
Society of London on the &ldquo;Organs of the Human Voice,&rdquo; in which
he gave many illustrations of the physiological action of these
parts, and in 1833 a Bridgewater treatise, <i>The Hand: its Mechanism
and Vital Endowments as evincing Design</i>. Along with Lord
Brougham he annotated and illustrated an edition of Paley&rsquo;s
<i>Natural Theology</i>, published in 1836. The Royal Society of
London awarded to him in 1829 the first annual medal of that
year given by George IV. for discoveries in science; and when
William IV. ascended the throne, Charles Bell received the
honour of knighthood along with a few other men distinguished
in science and literature.</p>

<p>In 1836 the chair of surgery in the university of Edinburgh
was offered to him. He was then one of the foremost scientific
men in London, and he had a large surgical practice. But his
opinion was &ldquo;London is a place to live in, but not to die in&rdquo;;
and he accepted the appointment. In Edinburgh he did not
earn great local professional success; and, it must be confessed,
he was not appreciated as he deserved. But honours came
thick upon him. On the continent of Europe he was spoken
of as greater than Harvey. It is narrated that one day P.J.
Roux, a celebrated French physiologist, dismissed his class
without a lecture, saying &ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est assez, messieurs, vous avez vu
Charles Bell.</i>&rdquo; During his professorship he published the <i>Institutes
of Surgery, arranged in the order of the lectures delivered in the
university of Edinburgh</i> (1838); and in 1841 he wrote a volume
of <i>Practical Essays</i>, two of which, &ldquo;On Squinting,&rdquo; and &ldquo;On

Hallow Park near Worcester on the 28th of April 1842.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELL, GEORGE JOSEPH<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> (1770-1843), Scottish jurist, was
born at Edinburgh on the 20th of March 1770. He was an elder
brother of Sir Charles Bell. At the age of eight he entered the
high school, but he received no university education further than
attending the lectures of A.F. Tytler, Dugald Stewart and
Hume. He became a member of the Faculty of Advocates in
1791, and was one of the earliest and most attached friends
of Francis Jeffrey. In 1804 he published a <i>Treatise on the Law
of Bankruptcy</i> in Scotland, which he subsequently enlarged
and published in 1826 under the title of <i>Commentaries on the Law
of Scotland and on the principles of Mercantile Jurisprudence&mdash;</i>
an institutional work of the very highest excellence, which has
had its value acknowledged by such eminent jurists as Joseph
Story and James Kent. In 1821 Bell was elected professor of
the law of Scotland in the university of Edinburgh; and in
1831 he was appointed to one of the principal clerkships in
the supreme court. He was placed at the head of a commission
in 1833 to inquire into the Scottish bankruptcy law;
and in consequence of the reports of the commissioners, chiefly
drawn up by himself, many beneficial alterations were made.
He died on the 23rd of September 1843. Bell&rsquo;s smaller treatise,
<i>Principles of the Law of Scotland</i>, became a standard text-book
for law students. The <i>Illustrations of the Principles</i>
 is also a work of high value.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BELL, HENRY<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> (1767-1830), Scottish engineer, was born
at Torphichen, Linlithgowshire, in 1767. Having received
the ordinary education of a parish school, he was apprenticed
to his uncle, a millwright, and, after qualifying himself as a
ship-modeller at Bo&rsquo;ness, went to London, where he found
employment under John Rennie, the celebrated engineer. Returning
to Scotland in 1790, he first settled as a carpenter at
Glasgow and afterwards removed to Helensburgh, on the Firth
of Clyde where he pursued his mechanical projects, and also
found occasional employment as an engineer. In January
1812 he placed on the Clyde a steamboat (which he named the
&ldquo;Comet&rdquo;) of about 25 tons, propelled by an engine of three
horse power, at a speed of 7 m. an hour. Although the honour
of priority is admitted to belong to the American engineer
Robert Fulton, there appears to be no doubt that Fulton had
received very material assistance in the construction of his
vessel from Bell and others in Great Britain. A handsome sum
was raised for Bell by subscription among the citizens of Glasgow;
and he also received from the trustees of the river Clyde a pension
of £100 a year. He died at Helensburgh on the 14th of November
1830. A monument to his memory stands on the banks of the
Clyde, at Dunglass, near Bowling.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BELL, HENRY GLASSFORD<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (1803-1874), a Scottish lawyer
and man of letters, was born at Glasgow on the 8th of November
1803. He received his education at the Glasgow high school
and at Edinburgh University. He became intimate with &ldquo;Delta&rdquo;
Moir, James Hogg, John Wilson (Christopher North), and others
of the brilliant staff of <i>Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine</i>,
to which he was drawn by his political sympathies.
In 1828 he became editor of the <i>Edinburgh Literary Journal</i>,
which was eventually incorporated in the <i>Edinburgh Weekly Chronicle</i>. He was admitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page686" id="page686"></a>686</span>
to the bar in 1832. In 1839 he was appointed sheriff-substitute
of Lanarkshire, and in 1867 he succeeded Sir Archibald Alison
in the post of sheriff-principal of the county, an office which he
filled with distinguished success. In 1831 he published <i>Summer
and Winter Hours</i>, a volume of poems, of which the best known
is that on Mary, queen of Scots. He further defended the cause of
the unfortunate queen in a prose <i>Life</i> (2 vols., 1828-1831).
Among his other works may be mentioned a preface which he
wrote to Bell and Bains&rsquo;s edition (1865) of the works of Shakespeare,
and <i>Romances and Minor Poems</i> (1866). He figures
in the society of the <i>Noctes Ambrosianae</i> as &ldquo;Tallboys.&rdquo; He
died on the 7th of January 1874.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BELL, JACOB<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> (1810-1859), British pharmaceutical chemist,
was born in London on the 5th of March 1810. On the completion
of his education, he joined his father in business as a
chemist in Oxford Street, and at the same time attended the
chemistry lectures at the Royal Institution, and those on
medicine at King&rsquo;s College. Always keenly alive to the interests
of chemists in general, Bell conceived the idea of a society which
should at once protect the interests of the trade, and improve
its status, and at a public meeting held on the 15th of April 1841,
it was resolved to found the Pharmaceutical Society of Great
Britain. Bell carried his scheme through in the face of many
difficulties, and further advanced the cause of pharmacy by
establishing the <i>Pharmaceutical Journal</i>, and superintending
its publication for eighteen years. The Pharmaceutical Society
was incorporated by royal charter in 1843. One of the first abuses
to engage the attention of the new body was the practice of
pharmacy by unqualified persons, and in 1845 Bell drew up the
draft of a bill to deal with the matter, one of the provisions of
which was the recognition of the Pharmaceutical Society as the
governing body in all questions connected with pharmacy.
For some time after this the question of pharmaceutical legislation
was widely discussed. In 1850 Bell successfully contested
the borough of St Albans in order that he might be able to advocate
his proposals for reform more effectually in parliament.
In 1851 he brought forward a bill embodying these proposals.
It passed its second reading, but was considerably whittled
down in committee, and when eventually it became law it only
partially represented its sponsor&rsquo;s intentions. Bell was the
author of an <i>Historical Sketch of the Progress of Pharmacy in
Great Britain</i>. He died on the 12th of June 1859.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BELL, JOHN<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> (1691-1780), Scottish traveller, was born at
Antermony in Scotland in 1691, and educated for the medical
profession, in which he took the degree of M.D. In 1714 he set
out for St Petersburg, where, through the introduction of a
countryman, he was nominated medical attendant to Valensky,
recently appointed to the Persian embassy, with whom he
travelled from 1715 to 1718. The next four years he spent in
an embassy to China, passing through Siberia and the great
Tatar deserts. He had scarcely rested from this last journey
when he was summoned to attend Peter the Great in his perilous
expedition to Derbend and the Caspian Gates. The narrative
of this journey he enriched with interesting particulars of the
public and private life of that remarkable prince. In 1738 he
was sent by the Russian government on a mission to Constantinople,
to which, accompanied by a single attendant who spoke
Turkish, he proceeded in the midst of winter and all the horrors
of war, returning in May to St Petersburg. It appears that
after this he was for several years established as a merchant
at Constantinople, where he married in 1746. In the following
year he retired to his estate of Antermony, where he spent the
remainder of his life. He died in 1780. His travels, published
at Glasgow in 1763, were speedily translated into French, and
widely circulated in Europe.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BELL, JOHN<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> (1763-1820), Scottish anatomist and surgeon,
an elder brother of Sir Charles Bell, was born at Edinburgh on
the 12th of May 1763. After completing his professional education
at Edinburgh, he carried on from 1790 in Surgeons&rsquo; Square
an anatomical lecture-theatre, where, in spite of much opposition,
due partly to the unconservative character of his teaching, he
attracted large audiences by his lectures, in which he was for a
time assisted by his younger brother Charles. In 1793-1795 he
published <i>Discourses on the Nature and Cure of Wounds</i>, and in
1800 he became involved in an unfortunate controversy with
James Gregory (1753-1821), the professor of medicine at Edinburgh.
Gregory in 1800 attacked the system whereby the
fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh acted in
rotation as surgeons at the Royal Infirmary, with the result
that the younger fellows were excluded. Bell, who was among
the number, composed an <i>Answer for the Junior Members</i> (1800),
and ten years later published a collection of <i>Letters on Professional
Character and Manners</i>, which he had addressed to Gregory.
After his exclusion from the infirmary he ceased to lecture and
devoted himself to study and practice. In 1816 he was injured
by a fall from his horse and in the following year went to Italy
for the benefit of his health. He died at Rome on the 15th of
April 1820. His works also included <i>Principles of Surgery</i> (1801),
<i>Anatomy of the Human Body</i>, which went through several
editions and was translated into German, and <i>Observations on
Italy</i>, published by his widow in 1825.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BELL, JOHN<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> (1797-1869), American political leader, was born
near Nashville, Tennessee, on the 15th of February 1797. He
graduated at the university of Nashville in 1814, and in 1817
was elected to the state senate, but retiring after one term, he
devoted himself for ten years to the study and the practice of
the law. From 1827 until 1841 he was a member of the national
House of Representatives, of which from June 1834 to March
1835 he was the speaker, and in which he was conspicuous as a
debater and a conservative leader. Though he entered political
life as a Democrat, he became estranged from his party&rsquo;s leader,
President Jackson, also a Tennessean, and after 1835 was one of
the leaders of the Whig party in the South. In March 1841 he
became the secretary of war in President Harrison&rsquo;s cabinet,
but in September, after the death of Harrison and the rupture
between the Whig leaders and President Tyler, he resigned this
position. From 1847 until 1859 he was a member of the United
States Senate, and attracted attention by his ability in debate
and his political independence, being one of two Southern
senators to vote against the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of 1854 and
against the admission of Kansas with the Lecompton or pro-slavery
constitution in 1858. Strongly conservative by temperament
and devoted to the Union, he ardently desired to prevent
the threatened secession of the Southern states in 1860, and
was the candidate, for the presidency, of the Constitutional
Union Party, often called from the names of its candidates for
the presidency and the vice-presidency (Edward Everett) the
&ldquo;Bell and Everett Party,&rdquo; which was made up largely of former
Whigs and Southern &ldquo;Know-Nothings,&rdquo; opposed sectionalism,
and strove to prevent the disruption of the union. The party
adopted no platform, and discarding all other issues, resolved
that &ldquo;it is both the part of patriotism and of duty to recognize
no political principle other than the constitution of the country,
the union of the states, and the enforcement of the laws.&rdquo; Bell
was defeated, but received a popular vote of 587,830 (mostly
cast in the Southern states), and obtained the electoral votes of
Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee&mdash;39 altogether, out of a total
of 303. Bell tried earnestly to prevent the secession of his own
state, but after the issue of President Lincoln&rsquo;s proclamation
of the 15th of April 1861 calling on the various states for volunteers,
his efforts were unavailing, and when Tennessee joined the
Confederacy Bell &ldquo;went with his state.&rdquo; He took no part in
the Civil War, and died on the 10th of September 1869.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELL, ROBERT<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (1800-1867), Irish man of letters, was born at
Cork on the 16th of January 1800. He was educated at Trinity
College, Dublin, where he was one of the founders of the Dublin
Historical Society. In 1828 he settled in London, where he
edited a weekly paper, the <i>Atlas</i>, and until 1841 was engaged
in journalism; and afterwards in miscellaneous literary work. He
died on the 12th of April 1867. His most important work is his
annotated edition of the <i>English Poets</i> (24 vols., 1854-1857;
new ed., 29 vols., 1866), the works of each poet being prefaced by
a memoir. For Lardner&rsquo;s <i>Cabinet Cyclopaedia</i> he wrote: <i>History
of Russia</i> (3 vols., 1836-1838); <i>Lives of English Poets</i> (2 vols.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page687" id="page687"></a>687</span>
1839); a continuation, with W. Wallace, of Sir James Mackintosh&rsquo;s
<i>History of England</i> (vols. iv.-x., 1830-1840); and the fifth
volume (1840) of the <i>Lives of the British Admirals</i>, begun by
R. Southey. He was a director of the Royal Literary Fund,

<p><span class="bold">BELL<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> a hollow metallic vessel used for making a more or less
loud noise (A.S. <i>bellan</i>, to bellow; Mid. Eng. &ldquo;to bell&rdquo;; cf.
&ldquo;As loud as belleth, winde in helle,&rdquo; in Chaucer, <i>House of Fame</i>,
iii. 713). Bells are usually cup-like in shape, and are constructed
so as to give one fundamental note when struck. The term does
not strictly include gongs, cymbals, metal plates, resonant bars
of metal or wood, or tinkling ornaments, such as <i>e.g.</i> the &ldquo;bells&rdquo;
upon the Jewish high priest&rsquo;s dress (Exodus xxviii. 32); nor is
it necessary here to deal with the common useful varieties of
sheep or cow bells, or bells on sledges or harness. For house
bells see the end of this article. A &ldquo;diving-bell&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Divers</a></span>)
is only so called from the analogy of its shape.</p>

<p>The main interest of bells and bell-ringing has reference to
church or tower bells, their history, construction and uses.</p>

<p><i>Early Bells.</i>&mdash;Of bells before the Christian era there is no
trustworthy evidence. The instruments which summoned the
Romans to public baths or processions, or that which Lucian
(<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 180) describes as set in motion by a water-clock (<i>clepsydra</i>)
to measure time, were probably cymbals or resonant plates of
metal, like the timbrels (<i>corybantia aera</i>, Virg. <i>Aen.</i> iii. 111)
used in the worship of Cybele, or the Egyptian <i>sistrum</i>, which
seems to have been a sort of rattle. The earliest Latin word
for a bell (<i>campana</i>) is late Latin of the 4th or 5th century
<span class="scs">A.D.</span>; and the first application of bells to churches has been
ascribed to Paulinus, bishop of Nola in Campania about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 400.
There is, however, no confirmation of this story, which may have
arisen from the words <i>campana</i> and <i>nola</i> (a small bell); and in a
letter from Paulinus to the emperor Severus, describing very
fully the decoration of his church, the bishop makes no mention
of bells. It has been maintained with somewhat more reason
that Pope Sabinianus (604) first used church bells; but it seems
clear that they were introduced into France as early as 550.
In the 7th century Bede mentions a bell brought from Italy
by Benedict Biscop for his abbey at Wearmouth, and speaks
of the sound of a bell being well known at Whitby Abbey at the
time of St Hilda&rsquo;s death (680). St Dunstan hung many in the
10th century; and in the 11th they were not uncommon in
Switzerland and Germany. It is said that the Greek Christians
were unacquainted with bells till the 9th century; but it is
known that for political reasons, after the taking of Constantinople
by the Turks in 1453, their use was forbidden lest they
should provide a popular signal for revolt.</p>

<p>Several old bells are extant in Scotland, Ireland and Wales;
the oldest are often quadrangular, made of thin iron plates
hammered and riveted together. A well-known specimen is
St Patrick&rsquo;s bell preserved at Belfast, called <i>Clog an eadhachta
Phatraic</i>, &ldquo;the bell of St Patrick&rsquo;s will.&rdquo; It is 6 in. high, 5
broad, 4 deep, adorned with gems and gold and silver filigree-work;
it is inscribed 1091 and 1105, but it is probably alluded to
in Ulster annals in 552. (For Scottish bells, see <i>Illustrated Catalogue
of Archaeological Museum</i>, Edinburgh, for 1856.)</p>

<p>The four-sided bell of the Irish missionary St Gall (646) is
preserved at the monastery of St Gall, Switzerland. In these
early times bells were usually small; even in the 11th century
a bell presented to the church at Orleans weighing 2600 &#8468; was
thought large. In the 13th century larger bells were cast. The
bell Jacqueline of Paris, cast in 1400, weighed 15,000 &#8468;; another
Paris bell of 1472, 25,000 &#8468;; and the famous Amboise bell at
Rouen (1501) 36,364 &#8468;</p>

<p>To these scanty records of the early history of bells may be
added the enumeration of different kinds of bells by Hieronymus
Magius, in his work <i>De Tintinnabulis</i>:&mdash;1. <i>Tintinnabulum</i>, a little
bell, otherwise called <i>tinniolum</i>, for refectory or dormitory, according
to Joannes Belethus, but Guillaume Durand names <i>squilla</i> for
the refectory; 2. <i>Petasius</i>, or larger &ldquo;broad-brimmed hat&rdquo; bell;
3. <i>Codon</i>, orifice of trumpet, a Greek hand-bell; 4. <i>Nola</i>, a very
small bell, used in the choir, according to Durand; 5. <i>Campana</i>, a
large bell, first used in the Latin churches in the steeple (Durand),
in the tower (Belethus); 6. <i>Squilla</i>, a shrill little bell. We read
of <i>cymbalum</i> for the cloister (Durand) or <i>campanella</i> for the
cloister (Belethus); <i>nolula</i> or <i>dupla</i> in the clock; <i>signum</i>
in the tower (<i>e.g.</i> in the <i>Excerptions</i> of St Egbert, 750); the
Portuguese still call a bell <i>sino.</i></p>

<p><i>Bell-founding.</i>&mdash;The earliest bells were probably not cast,
but made of plates riveted together, like the bells of St Gall
or Belfast above mentioned. The bell-founder&rsquo;s art, originally
practised in the monasteries, passed gradually into the hands
of a professional class, by whom, in England and the Low
Countries especially, were gradually worked out the principles
of construction, mixture of metals, lines and proportions, now
generally accepted as necessary for a good bell. In England
some of the early founders were peripatetic artificers, who
travelled about the country, setting up a temporary foundry
to cast bells wherever they were wanted. Miles Graye (<i>c.</i> 1650),
a celebrated East Anglian founder, carried on his work in this
fashion, and in old churchwardens&rsquo; accounts are sometimes
found notices of payment for the casting of bells at places where
no regular foundry is known to have existed. The chief centres
of the art in medieval times were London, York, Gloucester
and Nottingham; and bells by <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;John of York&rdquo; (14th
century), Samuel Smith, father and son, of York (1680-1730),
Abraham Rudhall and his descendants of Gloucester (1684-1774),
Mot (16th century), Lester and Pack (1750), Christopher
Hodson of London (who cast &ldquo;Great Tom&rdquo; of Oxford, 1681)
and Richard Phelps (1716) are still in high repute. The Whitechapel
Bell Foundry (now Mears and Stainbank), established
by Robert Mot in 1570, incorporated the business of the Rudhalls,
Lester and Pack, Phelps, Briant and others, and is now one
of the leading firms of bell-founders; others being Warner
and Sons of Spitalfields and Taylor &amp; Co., Loughborough, the
founders of &ldquo;Great Paul&rdquo; for St Paul&rsquo;s cathedral (1881). Of
Dutch and Flemish founders the firms of van den Gheyn (1550),
Hemony (1650), Aerschodt &amp; Wagheven at Louvain and others
have a great reputation in the Low Countries, especially for
&ldquo;carillons,&rdquo; such as those at Antwerp or Bruges, a form of
bell-music which has not taken much root in England, despite
the advocacy of the Rev. H.R. Haweis, who proclaimed its
superiority to English change-ringing.</p>

<p>Bell-metal is a mixture of copper and tin in the proportion
of 4 to 1. In Henry III.&rsquo;s reign it was 2 to 1. In Layard&rsquo;s
Nineveh bronze bells, it was 10 to 1. Zinc and lead are used in
small bells. The thickness of the bell&rsquo;s edge is about one-tenth
of its diameter, and its height is twelve times its thickness.</p>

<p>Bells, like viols, have been made of every conceivable shape
within certain limits. The long narrow bell, the quadrangular,
and the mitre-shaped in Europe at least indicate antiquity,
and the graceful curved-inwardly-midway and full trumpet-mouthed
bell indicates an age not earlier than the 16th century.</p>

<p>The bell is first designed on paper according to the scale of
measurement. Then the crook is made, which is a kind of double
wooden compass, the legs of which are respectively curved to
the shape of the inner and outer sides of the bell, a space of the
exact form and thickness of the bell being left betwixt them.
The compass is pivoted on a stake driven into the bottom of
the casting-pit. A stuffing of brickwork is built round the stake,
leaving room for a fire to be lighted inside it. The outside of this
stuffing is then padded with fine soft clay, well mixed and bound
together with calves&rsquo; hair, and the inner leg of the compass run
round it, bringing it to the exact shape of the inside of the bell.
Upon this <i>core</i>, well smeared with grease, is fashioned the false
clay bell, the outside of which is defined by the outer leg of the
compass. Inscriptions are now moulded in wax on the outside
of the clay-bell; these are carefully smeared with grease, then
lightly covered with the finest clay, and then with coarser clay,
until a solid mantle is thickened over the outside of the clay bell.
A fire is now lighted, and the whole baked hard; the grease and
wax inscriptions steam out through holes at the top, leaving
the sham clay bell baked hard and tolerably loose, between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page688" id="page688"></a>688</span>
<i>core</i> and the <i>cope</i> or <i>mantle</i>. The cope is then lifted, the clay
bell broken up, the <i>cope</i> let down again, enclosing now between
itself and the <i>core</i> the exact shape of the bell. The metal is then
boiled and run molten into the mould. A large bell will take
several weeks to cool. When extricated it ought to be scarcely
touched and should hardly require tuning. This is called its
maiden state, and it used to be so sought after that many bells
were left rough and out of tune in order to claim it.</p>

<p><i>Bell Tones and Tuning.</i>&mdash;A good bell, fairly struck, should
give out three distinct notes&mdash;a &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; note or &ldquo;tonic&rdquo;;
the octave above, or &ldquo;nominal&rdquo;; and the octave below, or
&ldquo;hum-note.&rdquo; (It also gives out the &ldquo;third&rdquo; and &ldquo;fifth&rdquo;
above the fundamental; but of these it is less necessary to take
notice.) Very few bells, however, have any two of these notes,
and hardly any all three, in unison&mdash;the &ldquo;hum-notes&rdquo; being
generally a little sharper, and the &ldquo;fundamentals&rdquo; a little
flatter, than their respective &ldquo;nominals.&rdquo; In tuning a &ldquo;ring&rdquo;
or series of bells, the practice of founders has hitherto been to
take one set of notes (in England usually the nominals, on the
continent the fundamentals) and put these into tune, leaving
the other tones to take care of themselves. But in different
circumstances different tones assert themselves. Thus, when
bells are struck at considerable intervals, the fundamental notes
being fuller and more persistent are more prominent; but when
struck in rapid succession (as in English change-ringing or
with the higher bells of a Belgian &ldquo;carillon,&rdquo; which take the
&ldquo;air&rdquo;) the higher tone of the &ldquo;nominal&rdquo; is more perceptible.
The inharmonious character of many Belgian carillons, and of
certain Belgian and French rings in England, is ascribed by
Canon A.B. Simpson (in his pamphlet, <i>Why Bells sound out of
Tune</i>, 1897) to neglect of the &ldquo;nominals,&rdquo; the fundamentals
only being tuned to each other. To tune a series of bells properly,
the fundamental tone of each bell must be brought into true
octave with its nominal, and the whole series of bells, thus
rectified, put into tune with each other. The &ldquo;hum-note&rdquo;
of each, which is the tone of the whole mass of metal, should also
be in tune with the others. If flatter than the nominal, it cannot
be sharpened; but if sharper (as is more usual), it may be flattened
by thinning the metal near the crown of the bell. The great bell
(&ldquo;Great Paul&rdquo;) cast by Messrs Taylor for St Paul&rsquo;s cathedral,
London, has all its tones in true harmony, except that the tone
next above the fundamental (E&#9837;) is a &ldquo;fourth&rdquo; (A&#9837;) instead
of a &ldquo;third&rdquo; (G or G&#9837;). The great bell cast by the same founders
for Beverley Minster is in perfect tune; and with the improved
machinery now in use, there is no reason why this should not
henceforth be the case with all church bells.</p>

<p>The quality of a bell depends not only on the casting and the
fineness and mixture of metals, but upon the due proportion of
metal to the calibre of the bell. The larger the bell the lower
the tone; but if we try to make a large E bell with metal only
enough for a smaller F bell, the E bell will be puny and poor. It
has been calculated that for a peal of bells to give the pure chord
of the ground tone or key-note, third, fifth and octave, the
diameters are required to be as thirty, twenty-four, twenty,
fifteen, and the weights as eighty, forty-one, twenty-four and
ten.</p>

<p><i>History and Uses of Bells.</i>&mdash;The history of bells is full of
romantic interest. In civilized times they have been intimately
associated, not only with all kinds of religious and social uses,
but with almost every important historical event. Their influence
upon architecture is not less remarkable, for to them indirectly
we probably owe most of the famous towers in the world.
Church towers at first, perhaps, scarcely rose above the roof,
being intended as lanterns for the admission of light, and addition
to their height was in all likelihood suggested by the more common
use of bells.</p>

<p>Bells early summoned soldiers to arms, as well as Christians
to church. They sounded the alarm in fire or tumult; and the
rights of the burghers in their bells were jealously guarded.
Thus the chief bell in the cathedral often belonged to the town,
not to the cathedral chapter. The curfew, the Carolus and
St Mary&rsquo;s bell in the Antwerp tower all belong to the town; the
rest are the property of the chapter. He who commanded the
bell commanded the town; for by that sound, at a moment&rsquo;s
notice, he could rally and concentrate his adherents. Hence a
conqueror commonly acknowledged the political importance of
bells by melting them down; and the cannon of the conquered
was in turn melted up to supply the garrison with bells to be used
in the suppression of revolts. Many a bloody chapter in history
has been rung in and out by bells.</p>

<p>On the third day of Easter 1282, at the ringing of the Sicilian
vespers (which have given their name to the affair), 8000 French
were massacred in cold blood by John of Procida, who had thus
planned to free Sicily from Charles of Anjou. On the 24th of
August, St Bartholomew&rsquo;s day, 1571, bells ushered in the
massacre of the Huguenots in France, to the number, it is said, of
100,000. Bells have rung alike over slaughtered and ransomed
cities; and far and wide throughout Europe in the hour of
victory or irreparable loss. At the news of Nelson&rsquo;s triumph
and death at Trafalgar, the bells of Chester rang a merry peal
alternated with one deep toll, and similar incidents could be
multiplied.</p>

<p>There are many old customs connected with the use of church
bells, some of which have died out, while others remain here and
there. The best known and perhaps oldest of these is the
&ldquo;Curfew&rdquo; (<i>couvre-feu</i>), first enforced (though not perhaps
introduced) by William the Conqueror in England as a signal for
all lights and fires to be extinguished at 8 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>&mdash;probably to
prevent nocturnal gatherings of disaffected subjects. In many
towns it survived into the 19th century as a signal for closing
shops at 8 or 9; and it is still kept up in various places as an old
custom; thus at Oxford the familiar boom of &ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s&rdquo; 101
strokes is still the signal for closing college gates at 9. The
largest and heaviest bells were used for the Curfew, to carry the
sound as far as possible, as it did to Milton&rsquo;s ear, suggesting the
descriptive lines in <i>Il Penseroso</i> (74-75):&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Oft, on a plot of rising ground,</p>
<p class="i05">I hear the far-off curfew sound</p>
<p class="i05">Over some wide-watered shore,</p>
<p class="i05">Swinging slow with sullen roar.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Gray&rsquo;s allusion in the <i>Elegy</i> is well known; as also are those of
Shakespeare to the elves &ldquo;that rejoice to hear the solemn
curfew&rdquo; (<i>Tempest</i>), or the fiend that &ldquo;begins at curfew and
walks till the first cock&rdquo; (<i>King Lear</i>); or Milton&rsquo;s in <i>Comus</i>
to the ghost &ldquo;that breaks his magic chains at curfew time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among secular uses connected with church bells are the
&ldquo;Mote&rdquo; or &ldquo;Common&rdquo; bell, summoning to municipal or other
meetings, as <i>e.g.</i> the 7th at St Mary&rsquo;s, Stamford, tolled for
quarter sessions, or the bell at St Mary&rsquo;s, Oxford, for meetings
of Convocation. In some places one of the bells is known as the
&ldquo;Vestry Bell.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Pancake Bell,&rdquo; still rung here and there
on Shrove Tuesday, was originally a summons to confession
before Lent; the &ldquo;Harvest Bell&rdquo; and &ldquo;Seeding Bell&rdquo; called
labourers to their work; while the &ldquo;Gleaning Bell&rdquo; fixed the
hours for beginning or leaving off gleaning, so that everyone
might start fair and have an even chance. The &ldquo;Oven Bell&rdquo;
gave notice when the lord of the manor&rsquo;s oven was ready for his
tenants to bake their bread; the &ldquo;Market Bell&rdquo; was a signal
for selling to begin; and in some country districts a church bell
is still rung at dinner time. The general diffusion of clocks and
watches has rendered bells less necessary for marking the events
of daily life; and most of these old customs have either disappeared
or are fast disappearing. At Strassburg a large bell
of eight tons weight, known as the &ldquo;Holy Ghost Bell,&rdquo; is only
rung when two fires are seen in the town at once; a &ldquo;storm-bell&rdquo;
warns travellers in the plain of storms approaching from
the mountains, and the &ldquo;Thor Glocke&rdquo; (gate bell) gives the
signal for opening or shutting the city gates. On the European
continent, especially in countries which, like Belgium and
Holland, were distracted by constant war, bells acquired great
public importance. They were formally baptized with religious
ceremonies (as also in England in pre-Reformation days), the
notabilities of a town or church standing as sponsors; and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page689" id="page689"></a>689</span>
were very generally supposed to have the power of scaring away
evil spirits.</p>

<p>Other old customs are naturally connected with the ecclesiastical
uses of bells. The &ldquo;Passing Bell,&rdquo; rung for the dying,
is now generally rung after death; the ancient mode of indicating
the sex of the deceased, viz. two pulls for a woman and three
for a man being still very common, with many varying customs
as regards the interval after death or the bell to be used, <i>e.g.</i>
smaller bells for children and females, and larger ones for aged
men; the tenor bell being sometimes reserved for the death of
the incumbent, or of a bishop or member of the royal family.
&ldquo;Burial Peals,&rdquo; once common at or after funerals to scare away
the evil spirits from the soul of the departed, though discouraged
by bishops as early as the 14th century, were kept alive by
popular superstition, and only finally checked in Puritan times;
but they have been revived, since the spread of change-ringing,
in the &ldquo;muffled peals&rdquo; now frequently rung as a mark of
respect to deceased persons of public or local importance, or the
short &ldquo;touches&rdquo; on hand-bells sometimes rung at the grave by
the comrades of a deceased ringer. The &ldquo;Sermon-Bell,&rdquo; rung
in pre-Reformation times to give notice that a sermon was to
be preached (cf. Shakespeare, <i>Henry IV.</i>, Pt. II. iv. 2. 4-7),
survives in some places in a custom of ringing the tenor bell
before a service with a sermon; and a similar custom before
a celebration of the Holy Communion preserves the memory of
the &ldquo;Sacrament Bell.&rdquo; The ancient &ldquo;Sanctus&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sance&rdquo;
bell, hung on the rood-screen or in a small bell cot on the chancel
gable, and sounded three times when the priest said the <i>Tersanctus</i>
(Holy, Holy, Holy) in the office of mass, was specially
obnoxious to Puritan zeal, and few of them survived the Reformation.
An early morning bell, rung in many places for no apparent
reason, is probably a relic of the <i>Ave Maria</i> or <i>Angelus</i>
bell. The inscription on some old bells, <i>Lectum fuge, discute
somnum</i> (&ldquo;Away from bed, shake off sleep&rdquo;), points to this use,
as also does the name &ldquo;Gabriel&rdquo; applied to the bell used for
ringing the Angelus. In old times bells were generally named
at their baptism, after the Virgin Mary or saints, or their donors;
thus the bells at Oseney Abbey in the 13th century were called
Hautclere, Doucement, Austyn, Marie, Gabriel and John;
sometimes they were known by mere nicknames, such as &ldquo;Great
(or &ldquo;Mighty&rdquo;) Tom&rdquo; at Oxford, or &ldquo;Big Ben,&rdquo; &ldquo;Great Paul,&rdquo;
&amp;c., in recent times.</p>

<p><i>Bell Inscriptions.</i>&mdash;The names of bells were often stamped
upon them in the casting; whence arose inscriptions upon church
bells, giving in monkish Latin the name of some saint, a prayer
to the Virgin, or for the soul of the donor, or a distich upon
the function of the bell itself; <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Funera plango, fulgura frango, Sabbata pango,</p>
<p class="i05">Excito lentos, dissipo ventos, paco cruentos.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p>(I mourn for death, I break the lightning, I fix the Sabbath, I
rouse the lazy, I scatter the winds, I appease the cruel.)</p>
</div>

<p>The character of the lettering and the foundry marks upon
old bells, are of great assistance in determining their date.
Sometimes a set of bells has each a separate verse, <i>e.g.</i> on a ring
of five in Bedfordshire:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>1st. &ldquo;Hoc signum Petri pulsatum nomine Christi.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="i1">(This emblem of Peter is struck in the name of Christ.)</p>

<p class="pt1">2nd. &ldquo;Nomen Magdalene campana sonat melode.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="i1">(This bell named Magdalen sounds melodiously.)</p>

<p class="pt1">3rd. &ldquo;Sit nomen Domini benedictum semper in eum.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="i1">(May the name of the Lord always be blessed upon him, <i>i.e.</i> on
    the bell when struck.)</p>

<p class="pt1">4th. &ldquo;Musa Raphaelis sonat auribus Immanuelis.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="i1">(The music of Raphael sounds in the ear of Immanuel.)</p>

<p class="pt1">5th. &ldquo;Sum Rosa pulsata mundique Maria vocata.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="i1">(I, Maria, am struck and called the Rose of the world.)</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>
</div>

<p>The names of these five bells were thus:&mdash;Peter, Magdalen,
(?) Jesus, Raphael and Mary.</p>

<p>Other inscriptions take the form of an invocation or prayer
for the bell itself, its donor or those who hear it, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Large Bells.</i>&mdash;There are a few bells of world-wide renown,
and several others more or less celebrated. The great bell at
Moscow, &ldquo;Tsar Kolokol,&rdquo; which, according to the inscription,
was cast in 1733, was in the earth 103 years and was raised by
the emperor Nicholas in 1836. The present bell seems never
to have been actually hung or rung, having been cracked in
the furnace; and it now stands on a raised platform in the
middle of a square. It is used as a chapel. It weighs about
180 tons, height 19 ft. 3 in., circumference 60 ft. 9 in., thickness
2 ft., weight of broken piece 11 tons. The second Moscow bell,
the largest in the world in actual use, weighs 128 tons. In a
pagoda in Upper Burma hangs a bell 16 ft. in diameter, weighing
about 80 tons. The great bell at Peking weighs 53 tons; Nanking,
22 tons; Olmutz, 17 tons; Vienna (1711), 17 tons;
Notre Dame (1680), 17 tons; Erfurt, 13 tons; Great Peter,
York Minster, recast in 1845, 12½ tons; Great Paul, at St Paul&rsquo;s
cathedral, 16¾ tons; Great Tom at Oxford, 7½ tons; Great
Tom at Lincoln, 5½ tons. Big Ben of the Westminster Clock
Tower weighs 13½ tons; it was cast by George Mears under
the direction of the first Lord Grimthorpe (E. Beckett Denison)
in 1858. Its four quarters were cast by Warner in 1856. The
&ldquo;Kaiserglocke&rdquo; of Cologne cathedral, recast in 1875, with
metal from French cannon captured in 1870-1871, weighs 27½ tons.</p>

<p>These large bells are either not moved at all, or only slightly
swung to enable the clapper to touch their side; in some cases
they are struck by a hammer or beam from outside. The heaviest
<i>ringing</i> peals in England are those at Exeter and St Paul&rsquo;s
cathedrals, tenors 72 cwt. and 62 cwt. respectively.</p>

<p><i>Bell-ringing.</i>&mdash;The science and art of bell-ringing, as practised
upon church and tower bells, falls under two main heads:&mdash;(1) Mechanical
ringing, in connexion with the machinery of a clock or &ldquo;carillon&rdquo;;
(2) Ringing by hand, by means of ropes attached
to the fittings of the bells, whereby the bell itself is either moved
as it hangs mouth downwards sufficiently for the clapper just
to touch its side (called technically &ldquo;chiming&rdquo;); or is swung
round nearly full circle with its mouth uppermost (technically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page690" id="page690"></a>690</span>
&ldquo;ringing&rdquo;), in which case the impact of the clapper is much
heavier, and the sound produced is consequently louder and more
far-reaching. Mechanical ringing is more common on the continent
of Europe, especially in Belgium and Flanders; ringing
by hand is more common in England, where the development
of change-ringing (see below) has brought it into prominence.</p>

<p>(1) Mechanical ringing is effected by a system of wires connected
with small hammers striking the bells, usually on their
outside, and worked either by connexion with the machinery
of a clock, so as to play tunes or artificially arranged chimes
at definite intervals; or with a key-board resembling that of
an organ. The first of these methods is familiar in the chimes
(Cambridge, Westminster, &amp;c.) heard from many towers at the
striking of the hours and quarters; or in hymn tunes played at
intervals (<i>e.g.</i> of three hours) upon the church bells. The second
method is peculiar to the &ldquo;carillon&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>), as found everywhere
in Belgium, where with a set of from 20 or 30 to 60 or 70 bells
a much wider scope for tunes and harmonies is provided than
in English belfries, few of which have more than one octave of
bells in one key only and none more than 12 bells. The carillons
at Louvain and Bruges contain 40 bells, and that of Mechlin
44, while in the tower of Antwerp cathedral there are upwards of
90 bells, for the largest of which, cast in 1507, Charles V. stood
sponsor at its consecration.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Ringing by Hand.</i>&mdash;Church bells may be &ldquo;chimed&rdquo; or
&ldquo;rung&rdquo; (see above). One man can, as a rule, chime three bells,
with a rope in each hand and one foot in the loop of another;
but by the use of an &ldquo;Ellacombe&rdquo; or other chiming apparatus
one man can work six, eight or ten bells. Some prefer the
quieter sound of chiming as an introduction to divine service,
but where a band of ringers is available and change-ringing is
practised the bells as a rule are rung. The practice of &ldquo;clocking&rdquo;
a bell, in which the clapper, by means of a cord attached to it
and pulled from below, is allowed to swing against the bell at
rest, is often employed to save trouble; but the jar is very
likely to crack the bell. In ringing, or in true chiming, the bell
is in motion when struck.</p>

<p>For ringing, a bell is pulled up and &ldquo;set&rdquo; mouth uppermost.
She (to ringers a bell is feminine) is then pulled off, first at
&ldquo;handstroke&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> with the hands on the &ldquo;sally&rdquo; or tufted
portion of the rope, a few feet from its lower end) and then at
&ldquo;back-stroke&rdquo; in the reverse direction (with the hands nearer
the lower end, the rope having at the previous pull coiled round
three-quarters of the wheel&rsquo;s circumference), describing at each
pull almost a full circle till she comes back to the upright position.
At each revolution the swing is chiefly done by the weight of the
bell, the ringer giving a pull of just sufficient strength to bring
the bell back into the upright position; otherwise its swing
would become gradually shorter till it remained at rest mouth downwards.</p>

<p><i>Change-ringing</i>.&mdash;When a given number of bells are rung over
and over again in the same order, from the highest note, or
&ldquo;treble,&rdquo; to the lowest, or &ldquo;tenor&rdquo;&mdash;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7&mdash;they are
said to be rung in &ldquo;rounds.&rdquo; &ldquo;Changes&rdquo; are variations of this
order&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> 2 1 3 5 4 7 6, 2 3 1 4 5 6 7; and &ldquo;change-ringing&rdquo;
is the art of ringing bells in &ldquo;changes,&rdquo; so that a different
&ldquo;change&rdquo; or rearrangement of order is produced at each pull
of the bell-ropes, until, without any repetition of the same
change, the bells come back into &ldquo;rounds.&rdquo; The general principle
of all methods of change-ringing is that each bell, after
striking in the first place or &ldquo;lead,&rdquo; works gradually &ldquo;up&rdquo; to
the last place or &ldquo;behind,&rdquo; and &ldquo;down&rdquo; again to the first, and
that no bell ever shifts more than one place in each change.
Thus the ringer of any bell knows that whatever his position
in one change, his place in the next will be either the same, or the
place before or the place after. He does not have to learn by
heart the different changes or variations of order; nor need he,
unless he is the &ldquo;conductor,&rdquo; know the exact order of any one
change. He has to bear in mind, first, which way his bell is
working, viz. whether &ldquo;up&rdquo; from first to last place, or &ldquo;down&rdquo;
from last to first; secondly, in what place his bell is striking;
thirdly, what bell or bells are striking immediately before or
after him&mdash;this being ascertained chiefly by &ldquo;rope-sight,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
the knack, acquired by practice, of seeing which rope is being
pulled immediately before and after his own. He must also
remember and apply the rules of the particular &ldquo;method&rdquo;
which is being rung. The following table representing the first
twenty changes of a &ldquo;plain course&rdquo; of &ldquo;Grandsire Triples&rdquo;
(for these terms, see below) illustrates the subject-matter of this
section:&mdash;</p>

<p>It will be observed that at the 1st change the third bell and
at the 15th the fifth bell, according to the rule of this &ldquo;method,&rdquo;
strikes a second blow in the third place (&ldquo;makes third&rsquo;s place&rdquo;).
This stops the regular work of the bells which at the previous
change were in the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th places (&ldquo;in 4, 5, 6, 7&rdquo;),
causing them to take a step backwards in their course &ldquo;up&rdquo; or
&ldquo;down,&rdquo; or as it is technically called, to &ldquo;dodge.&rdquo; Were it not
for this, the bells would come back into &ldquo;rounds&rdquo; at the 14th
change. It is by the use of &ldquo;place-making&rdquo; and &ldquo;dodging,&rdquo;
according to the rules of various &ldquo;methods,&rdquo; that the required
number of changes, upon any number of bells, can be produced.
But in order that this may be done, without the bells coming
back into &ldquo;rounds&rdquo; (as, <i>e.g.</i> in the &ldquo;plain course&rdquo; of Grandsire
Triples, above given, they will do in seventy changes), further
modifications of the &ldquo;coursing order,&rdquo; called technically &ldquo;Bobs&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Singles,&rdquo; must be introduced. In ringing, notice of these
alterations as they occur is given by one of the ringers, who acts
as &ldquo;conductor,&rdquo; calling out &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; or &ldquo;Single&rdquo; at the right
moment to warn the ringers of certain bells to make the requisite
alteration in the regular work of their bells. (Hence, in ringing
language, to &ldquo;call&rdquo; a peal or touch = to conduct it.) Particulars
of these, as of other details of change-ringing, may be gathered
from books dealing with the technique of the art; but they are
best mastered in actual practice. The term &ldquo;single,&rdquo; applied
to five-bell ringing meant that, as the first three bells remained
unchanged, only a single pair of bells changed places, <i>e.g.</i>
1 5 4 3 2, 1 5 4 2 3. On larger numbers of bells it loses this
meaning; but the effect of this &ldquo;call&rdquo; is that the &ldquo;coursing
order&rdquo; of a single pair of bells is inverted. The origin of &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; is
unknown. As a &ldquo;call&rdquo; it was perhaps adopted as a short, sharp
sound, easily uttered and easily heard by the ringers. As
applied to a &ldquo;method&rdquo; or system of ringing it may refer to the
evolution of &ldquo;dodging,&rdquo; <i>e.g.</i> in &ldquo;Treble Bob&rdquo; to the zigzag
&ldquo;dodging&rdquo; path of the treble bell; but none of the old writers
attempts to explain it.</p>

<p>The number of <i>possible</i> &ldquo;changes&rdquo; on any given series of bells
may be ascertained, according to the mathematical formula of
&ldquo;permutations,&rdquo; by multiplying the number of the bells together.
Thus on three bells, only 6 changes or variations of order (1 × 2 × 3)
can be produced; on four bells, 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24; on five,
24 × 5 = 120; on six, 120 × 6 = 720; on seven, 720 × 7 = 5040.
A &ldquo;peal&rdquo; on any such number of bells is in ordinary language
the ringing of all the possible changes. But technically, only
the full extent of changes upon seven bells, usually rung with a
&ldquo;tenor behind,&rdquo; is called a &ldquo;peal&rdquo;; a shorter performance
upon seven or more bells, or the full extent upon less than seven,
being, in ringing parlance, a &ldquo;touch.&rdquo; On six bells the full
extent of changes must be repeated continuously seven times
(720 × 7 = 5040), and on five bells forty-two times (l20 × 42
= 5040) to rank as a &ldquo;peal.&rdquo; On eight or more bells 5000
changes in round numbers is accepted as the <i>minimum</i> standard
for a peal; and on such numbers of bells up to twelve (the
largest number used in change-ringing), peals are so arranged
that the bells come into rounds at, or at some point beyond,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page691" id="page691"></a>691</span>
5000 changes. As many as 16,000 changes, occupying from nine
to ten hours, have been rung upon church bells. But the great
physical strain upon the ringers&mdash;to say nothing of the effect
upon those who are within hearing&mdash;makes such performances
exceptional. The word &ldquo;peal&rdquo; is often, though incorrectly, used
(1) for a set of church bells (&ldquo;a peal of six,&rdquo; &ldquo;a peal of eight&rdquo;),
for which the correct term is &ldquo;a ring&rdquo; of bells; (2) for any
shorter performance than a full peal (<i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;wedding-peal,&rdquo;
&ldquo;muffled peal,&rdquo; &amp;c.), called in ringing language a &ldquo;touch.&rdquo;
Its use as equivalent for &ldquo;method,&rdquo; found in old campanological
works, is now obsolete.</p>

<p>Change-ringing upon five bells is called &ldquo;Doubles,&rdquo; upon
seven bells &ldquo;Triples,&rdquo; upon nine &ldquo;Caters&rdquo; (Fr. <i>quatre</i>), and
upon eleven &ldquo;Cinques,&rdquo; from the fact that at each change two,
three, four or five pairs of bells change places with each other.
&ldquo;Doubles&rdquo; can be and are rung when there are only five bells;
but as a rule these &ldquo;odd-bell&rdquo; systems are rung with a &ldquo;tenor
behind,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> struck at the end of each change; the number of
bells in a tower being usually an even number&mdash;six, eight, ten
or twelve. In &ldquo;even-bell&rdquo; systems the tenor is &ldquo;rung in&rdquo;
or &ldquo;turned in,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> changes with the other bells, and a different
terminology is employed; change-ringing on six bells being
called &ldquo;Minor&rdquo;; on eight bells, &ldquo;Major&rdquo;; on ten bells,
&ldquo;Royal&rdquo;; and on twelve, &ldquo;Maximus.&rdquo; The principal
&ldquo;methods&rdquo; of change-ringing, each of which has its special
rules, are&mdash;(1) &ldquo;Grandsire&rdquo;; (2) &ldquo;Plain Bob&rdquo;; (3) &ldquo;Treble Bob&rdquo;;
(4) &ldquo;Stedman,&rdquo; from the name of its inventor, Fabian
Stedman, about 1670. In &ldquo;Grandsire&rdquo; the treble and one other
bell, in &ldquo;Plain Bob&rdquo; the treble alone, has a &ldquo;plain hunt,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>
works from the first place, or &ldquo;lead,&rdquo; to the last place, or
&ldquo;behind,&rdquo; and back again, without any dodging; in &ldquo;Treble
Bob&rdquo; the treble has a uniform but zigzag course, dodging in
each place on its way up and down. This is called a &ldquo;Treble
Bob hunt&rdquo;; and under these two heads, according to the work
of the treble, are classified a variety of &ldquo;plain methods&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Treble Bob methods,&rdquo; among the latter being the so-called
&ldquo;Surprise&rdquo; methods, the most complicated and difficult of all.
&ldquo;Stedman&rsquo;s principle,&rdquo; which is <i>sui generis</i>, consists in the three
front bells ringing their six possible changes, while the remaining
pair or pairs of bells dodge. It is thus an &ldquo;odd-bell&rdquo; method
adapted to five, seven, nine or eleven bells; as also is
&ldquo;Grandsire,&rdquo; though occasionally rung on even numbers of bells.
&ldquo;Treble Bob&rdquo; is always, and &ldquo;Plain Bob&rdquo; generally, rung
on even numbers&mdash;six, eight, ten or twelve. In ringing, whenever
the treble has a uniform course, unaffected by &ldquo;Bobs&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Singles,&rdquo; it serves as a guide to the other changing bells,
according to the place in which they meet and cross its path from
&ldquo;behind&rdquo; to the &ldquo;lead.&rdquo; The order in which the different dodges
occur, and the &ldquo;course bell,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the bell which he follows from
behind to lead, are also useful, and on large numbers of bells
indispensable, guides to the ringer.</p>

<p>Quite distinct from the art of change-ringing is the science
of &ldquo;composing,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> arranging and uniting by the proper
&ldquo;calls,&rdquo; subject to certain fixed laws and conditions, a number
of groups of changes, so that no one change, or series of changes
represented in those groups, shall be repeated. A composition,
long or short, is said to be &ldquo;true&rdquo; if it is free from, &ldquo;false&rdquo;
if it involves, such repetition; and the body of ascertained laws
and conditions governing true composition in any method
constitutes the test or &ldquo;proof&rdquo; to be applied to a composition
in that method to demonstrate its truth or falseness. Many practical
ringers know little or nothing of the principles of composition,
and are content with performing compositions received from
composers, or published in ringing books and periodicals. An
elaborate statement of the principles of composition in the
&ldquo;Grandsire&rdquo; method may be found in an appendix to Snowdon&rsquo;s
<i>Grandsire</i> (1888), by the Rev. C.D.P. Davies. Those which
apply to &ldquo;Treble Bob&rdquo; are explained in Snowdon&rsquo;s <i>Treatise on
Treble Bob</i>, Part I. But, so far as can be ascertained, there is no
treatise dealing with the science of composition as a whole; nor is
it possible here to attempt a popular exposition of its principles.</p>

<p>One of the objects kept in view by composers is musical
effect. Certain sequences or contrasts of notes strike the ear as
more musical than others; and an arrangement which brings
up the more musical changes in quicker succession improves
the musical effect of the &ldquo;peal&rdquo; or &ldquo;touch.&rdquo; On seven bells
all the possible changes must be inserted in a true peal; but on
larger numbers of bells, where the choice is from an immense
number of possible changes, the composer is free to select those
which are most musical. Unless, however, the bells of any given
&ldquo;ring&rdquo; are in perfect tune and harmony with each other, their
musical effect must be impaired, however well they are rung.
This gives importance to the science and art of bell-tuning,
in which great progress has been made (see above).</p>

<p>The art of scientific change-ringing, peculiar to England,
does not seem to have been evolved before the middle of the
17th century. Societies or gilds of ringers, however, existed
much earlier. A patent roll of 39 Henry III. (1255) confirms
the &ldquo;Brethren of the Guild of Westminster, who are appointed
to ring the great bells there,&rdquo; in the enjoyment of the &ldquo;privileges
and free customs which they have enjoyed from the time of
Edward the Confessor.&rdquo; In 1602 (as appears from a MS. in the
library of All Souls&rsquo; College, Oxford) was founded a society
called the &ldquo;Scholars of Cheapside.&rdquo; In 1637 began the &ldquo;Ancient
Society of College Youths,&rdquo; so called from their meeting to practise
on the six bells at St Martin&rsquo;s, College Hill, a church destroyed
in the Great Fire of London, 1666. At first only &ldquo;rounds&rdquo;
and &ldquo;call-changes&rdquo; were rung, till about 1642, when 120
&ldquo;Bob Doubles&rdquo; were achieved; but slow progress was made
till 1677, when Fabian Stedman of Cambridge published his
<i>Campanologia</i>, dedicating it to this society, his method being
first rung about this time by some of its members. Before the
end of the 17th century was founded the &ldquo;Society of London
Scholars,&rdquo; the name of which was changed in 1746 to &ldquo;Cumberland
Youths&rdquo; in compliment to the victor of Culloden. These
two metropolitan societies still exist, and include in their membership
most of the leading change-ringers of England: one of the
oldest provincial societies being that of Saffron Walden in
Essex, founded in 1623, and still holding an annual ringing
festival. In the latter half of the 18th and first half of the 19th
century change-ringing, which at first seems to have been an
aristocratic pastime, degenerated in social repute. Church
bells and their ringers, neglected by church authorities, became
associated with the lower and least reputable phases of parochial
life; and belfries were too often an adjunct to the pothouse.
In the last half of the 19th century there was a great revival
of change-ringing, leading to improvements in belfries and in
ringers, and to their gradual recognition as church workers.
Diocesan or county associations for the promotion of change-ringing
and of belfry reform spread knowledge of the art and
aroused church officials to greater interest in and care for their
bells. A Central Council of Church Bell Ringers, consisting
of delegates from these various societies, meets annually in
London or at some provincial centre to discuss ringing matters,
and to collect and formulate useful knowledge upon practical
questions&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> the proper care of bells and the means of preventing
annoyance from their use in the neighbourhood of houses,
rules for the conduct of belfries, &amp;c. It is now less likely than
ever that the Belgian carillons will be preferred in England to
the peculiarly English system of ringing bells in peal; by which,
whatever its difficulties, the musical sound of bells is most fully
brought out, and their scientific construction best stimulated.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;The literature of bell-lore (or campanology)
consists chiefly of scattered treatises or pamphlets upon the technique
of different methods of change-ringing, or upon the bells of
particular counties or districts. The earliest that deal with the
science and art of change-ringing are <i>Campanologia or the Art of
Ringing Improved</i> (1677), and a chapter of &ldquo;Advice to a Ringer&rdquo;
in the <i>School of Recreations, or Gentleman&rsquo;s Tutor</i> (1684), showing
that in its early days bell-ringing was a fashionable pastime. Then
follow <i>Campanologia, or the Art of Ringing made Easy</i> (1766), <i>Clavis
Campanologia, a Key to Ringing</i> (1788), and Shipway&rsquo;s <i>Campanologia</i>
(1816). The revival of change-ringing in recent years has produced
many manuals: <i>e.g.</i> Snowdon&rsquo;s <i>Rope-Sight</i> (explaining the &ldquo;Plain Bob&rdquo;
method), <i>Grandsire, Treatise on Treble Bob, Double Norwich
Court Bob Major</i>, and <i>Standard Methods</i> (with a book of diagrams);

Troyte on <i>Change-Ringing</i>; <i>The Duffield Method</i>, by Sir A.P.
Heywood, Bart., its inventor. Somewhat prior to these are various
works by the Rev. H.T. Ellacombe, inventor of a chiming apparatus
which bears his name, and a pioneer in belfry reform. Among these
are accounts of the church bells of Devon, Somerset and Gloucester,
and pamphlets on <i>Belfries and Ringers, Chiming, &amp;c.</i>; much of their
contents being summarized in <i>The Ringer&rsquo;s Guide to the Church Bells
of Devon</i>, by C. Pearson (1888). A <i>Glossary of Technical Terms</i> used
in connexion with church bells and change-ringing was published
(1901) under the auspices of the Central Council of Church Bell
Ringers. On the history of church bells and customs connected with
them much curious information is given in North&rsquo;s <i>English Bells
and Bell Lore</i> (1888). By the same author are monographs on the
church bells of Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Lincolnshire and
Hertfordshire. There are similar works on the church bells of Suffolk
and Cambridgeshire, by Dr Raven; of Huntingdonshire, by the
Rev. T.M.N. Owen; and on the church bells of Essex, by the
Rev. C. Deedes. A compilation and summary of many data of bell-lore
will be found in <i>A Book about Bells</i>, by the Rev. G.S. Tyack;
and in a volume by Dr Raven in the &ldquo;Antiquary&rsquo;s Books&rdquo; series

<p><i>House Bells.</i>&mdash;Buildings are commonly provided with bells,
conveniently arranged so as to enable attendants to be summoned
to the different rooms. In the old system, which has been
largely superseded by pneumatic and still more by electric bells,
the bells themselves are of the ordinary conical shape and are
provided with clappers hung loosely inside them. Being supported
on springs they continue to swing, and therefore to give
out sound as the clapper knocks against the sides, for some time
after they have been set in motion by means of the strings or
wires by which each is connected to a bell-pull in the rooms.
These wires are generally placed out of sight inside the walls,
and bell-cranks are employed to take them round corners and
to change the direction of motion as required. A lightly poised
pendulum is often attached to each bell, to show by its motion
when it has been rung. In pneumatic bells the wires are replaced
by pipes of narrow bore, and the current of air which is caused
to flow along these by the pressing of a push-button actuates
a small hammer which impinges rapidly against a bell or gong.
An electric bell consists of a small electro-magnet acting on a
soft iron armature which is supported in such a way that normally
it stands away from the magnet. When the latter is energized
by the passage of an electric current, the armature is attracted
towards it, and a small hammer attached to it strikes a blow on
the bell or gong. This &ldquo;single stroke&rdquo; type of bell is largely
used in railway signalling instruments. For domestic purposes,
however, the bells are arranged so that the hammer strikes a series
of strokes, continuing so long as the push-button which closes
the electric circuit is pressed. A light spring is provided against
which the armature rests when it is not attracted by the electro-magnet,
and the current is arranged to pass through this spring
and the armature on its way to the magnet. When the armature
is attracted by the magnet it breaks contact with this spring,
the current is interrupted, and the magnet being no longer
energized allows the armature to fall back on the spring and thus
restore the circuit. In this way a rapid to and fro motion is
imparted to the hammer. The electric current is supplied by a
battery, usually either of Leclanché or of dry cells. One bell
will serve for all the rooms of a house, an &ldquo;indicator&rdquo; being
provided to show from which it has been rung. Such indicators
are of two main types: the current either sets in motion a
pendulum, or causes a disk bearing the name or number of the
room concerned to come into view. Each push must have one
wire appropriated to itself leading from the battery through
the indicator to the bell, but the return wire from the bell to
the battery may be common to all the pushes. Bells of this kind
cease to ring whenever the electrical continuity of any of these
wires is interrupted, but in some cases, as in connexion with
burglar-alarms, it is desirable that the bell, once set in action,
shall continue to ring even though the wires are cut.
For this purpose, in &ldquo;continuous ringing&rdquo; bells, the current,
started by the push or alarm apparatus, instead of working
the bell, is made to operate a relay-switch and thus to bring into
circuit a second battery which continues to ring the bell, no
matter what happens to the first circuit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELLADONNA<a name="ar100" id="ar100"></a></span> (from the Ital. <i>bella donna</i>, &ldquo;beautiful lady,&rdquo;
the berries having been used as a cosmetic), the roots and leaves of
<i>Atropa belladonna</i>, or deadly nightshade (<i>q.v.</i>), widely used in
medicine on account of the alkaloids which they contain. Of
these the more important are atropine (or atropia), hyoscyamine,
hyoscine and belladonine; atropine is the most important,
occurring as the malate to the extent of about 0.47% in the leaves,
and from 0.6 to 0.25% in the roots.</p>

<p>Atropine, C<span class="su">17</span>H<span class="su">23</span>NO<span class="su">3</span>, was discovered in 1833 by P.L. Geiger
and Hesse and by Mein in the tissues of <i>Atropa belladonna</i>, from
which it may be extracted by means of chloroform. By crystallization
from alcohol it is obtained as colourless needles, melting
at 115°. Hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid or baryta water
gives tropic acid and tropine; on the other hand, by boiling
equimolecular quantities of these substances with dilute hydrochloric
acid, atropine is reformed. Since both these substances
have been synthesized (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tropine</a></span>), the artificial formation
of atropine is accomplished. Atropine is optically inactive;
hyoscyamine, possibly a physical isomer, which yields atropine
when heated to 108.6°, is laevorotatory.</p>

<p><i>Medicine.</i>&mdash;The official doses of atropine are from <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">200</span> to <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">100</span>
grain, and the sulphate, which is in general use in medicine,
has a similar dose. It is highly important to observe that the
official doses of the various pharmacopoeias may with safety
be greatly exceeded in practice. They are based on the experimental
<i>toxic</i>, as distinguished from <i>lethal</i> dose. A toxic
dose causes unpleasant symptoms, but in certain cases, such as
this, it may require very many times a toxic dose to produce
the lethal effect. In other words, whilst one-fiftieth of a grain
may cause unpleasant symptoms, it may need more than a grain
to kill. So valuable are certain of the properties of atropine
that it is often desirable to give doses of one-twentieth or one-tenth
of a grain; but these will never be ventured upon by the
practitioner who is ignorant of the great interval between the
minimum toxic and the minimum lethal dose. It actually needs
twenty to thirty grains of atropine to kill a rabbit: the animal
is, however, somewhat exceptional in this regard. The most
valuable preparations of this potent drug are the <i>liquor atropinae
sulphatis</i>, which is a 1% solution, and the <i>lamella</i>&mdash;for insertion
within the conjunctival sac&mdash;which contains one five-thousandth
part of a grain of the alkaloid.</p>

<p><i>Pharmacology.</i>&mdash;When rubbed into the skin with such substances
as alcohol or glycerine, which are absorbed, atropine is
carried through the epidermis with them, and in this manner&mdash;or
when simply applied to a raw surface&mdash;it paralyses the
terminals of the pain-conducting sensory nerves. It acts
similarly, though less markedly, upon the nerves which determine
the secretion of the perspiration, and is therefore a local anaesthetic
or anodyne and an anhidrotic. Being rapidly absorbed
into the blood, it exercises a long and highly important series of
actions on nearly every part and function of the nervous system.
Perhaps its most remarkable action is that upon the terminals
of nearly all the secretory nerves in the body. This causes the
entire skin to become dry&mdash;as in the case of the local action above
mentioned; and it arrests the secretion of saliva and mucus in
the mouth and throat, causing these parts to become very dry
and to feel very uncomfortable. This latter result is due to
paralysis of the <i>chorda tympani</i> nerve, which is mainly responsible
for the salivary secretion. Certain nerve fibres from the sympathetic
nervous system, which can also cause the secretion of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page693" id="page693"></a>693</span>
(specially viscous) saliva, are entirely unaffected by atropine.
A curious parallel to this occurs in its action on the eye. There
is much uncertainty as to the influence of atropine on the secretions
of the stomach, intestines, liver, pancreas and kidneys, and
it is not possible to make any definite statement, save that in all
probability the activities of the nerves innervating the gland-cells
in these organs are reduced, though they are certainly not
arrested, as in the other cases. The secretion of mucus by the
bronchi and trachea is greatly reduced and their muscular tissue
is paralysed&mdash;a fact of which much use is made in practical
medicine. The secretion of milk, if occurring in the mammary
gland, is much diminished or entirely arrested. Given internally,
atropine does not exert any appreciable sedative action upon the
nerves of pain.</p>

<p>The action of atropine on the motor nerves is equally important.
Those that go to the voluntary muscles are depressed only by
very large and dangerous doses. The drug appears to have no
influence upon the contractile cells that constitute muscle-fibre,
any more than it has directly upon the secretory cells that
constitute any gland. But moderate doses of atropine markedly
paralyse the terminals of the nerves that go to involuntary
muscles, whether the action of those nerves be motor or inhibitory.
In the intestine, for instance, are layers of muscle-fibre which are
constantly being inhibited or kept under check by the splanchnic
nerves. These are paralysed by atropine, and intestinal peristalsis
is consequently made more active, the muscles being
released from nervous control. The motor nerves of the arteries,
of the bladder and rectal sphincters, and also of the bronchi, are
paralysed by atropine, but the nervous arrangements of those
organs are highly complex and until they are further unravelled
by physiologists, pharmacology will be unable to give much
information which might be of great value in the employment
of atropine. The action upon the vaso-motor system is, however,
fairly clear. Whether effected entirely by action on the nerve
terminals, or by an additional influence upon the vaso-motor
centre in the medulla oblongata, atropine certainly causes
extreme dilatation of the blood-vessels, so much so that the skin
becomes flushed and there may appear, after large doses, an
erythematous rash, which must be carefully distinguished, in
cases of supposed belladonna poisoning, from that of scarlet fever:
more especially as the temperature may be elevated and the
pulse is very rapid in both conditions. But whilst the characteristic
action of atropine is to dilate the blood-vessels, its first
action is to stimulate the vaso-motor centre&mdash;thereby causing
temporary contraction of the vessels&mdash;and to increase the rapidity
of the heart&rsquo;s action, so that the blood-pressure rapidly rises.
Though transient, this action is so certain, marked and rapid,
as to make the subcutaneous injection of atropine invaluable
in certain conditions. The respiratory centre is similarly
stimulated, so that atropine must be regarded as a temporary
but efficient respiratory and cardiac stimulant.</p>

<p>Toxic doses of atropine&mdash;and therefore of belladonna&mdash;raise
the temperature several degrees. The action is probably nervous,
but in the present state of our knowledge regarding the control
of the temperature by the nervous system, it cannot be further
defined. In small therapeutic and in small toxic doses atropine
stimulates the motor apparatus of the spinal cord, just as it
stimulates the centres in the medulla oblongata. This is indeed,
as Sir Thomas Fraser has pointed out, &ldquo;a strychnine action.&rdquo;
In large toxic and in lethal doses the activity of the spinal cord
is lowered.</p>

<p>No less important than any of the above is the action of
atropine on the cerebrum. This has long been a debated matter,
but it may now be stated, with considerable certainty, that the
higher centres are incoordinately stimulated, a state closely
resembling that of delirium tremens being induced. In cases
of poisoning the delirium may last for many hours or even days.
Thereafter a more or less sleepy state supervenes, but it is not the
case that atropine ever causes genuine coma. The stuporose
condition is the result of exhaustion after the long period of
cerebral excitement. It is to be noted that children, who are
particularly susceptible to the influence of certain of the other
potent alkaloids, such as morphine and strychnine, will take
relatively large doses of atropine without ill-effect.</p>

<p>The action of atropine on the eye is of high theoretical and
practical importance. The drug affects only the involuntary
muscles of the eye, just as it affects only the involuntary or
non-striated portion of the oesophagus. The result of its instillation
into the eye&mdash;and the same occurs when the atropine
has been absorbed elsewhere&mdash;is rapidly to cause wide dilatation
of the pupil. This can be experimentally shown&mdash;by the method
of exclusion&mdash;to be caused by a paralysis of the terminals of the
third cranial nerve in the <i>sphincter pupillae</i> of the iris. The
action of atropine in dilating the pupil is also aided by a stimulation
of the fibres from the sympathetic nervous system, which
innervate the remaining muscle of the iris&mdash;the <i>dilator pupillae</i>.
As a result of the extreme pupillary dilatation, the tension of the
eyeball is greatly raised. The sight of many an eye has been
destroyed by the use of atropine&mdash;in ignorance of this action on
the intra-ocular tension&mdash;in cases of incipient glaucoma. The
use of atropine is absolutely contra-indicated in any case where
the intra-ocular tension already is, or threatens to become,
unduly high. This warning applies notably to those&mdash;usually
women&mdash;who are accustomed indiscriminately to use belladonna
or atropine in order to give greater brilliancy to their eyes. The
fourth ocular result of administering atropine is the production
of a slight but definite degree of local anaesthesia of the eyeball.
It follows from the above that a patient who is definitely under
the influence of atropine will display rapid pulse, dilated pupils,
a dry skin and a sense of discomfort, due to dryness of the mouth
and throat.</p>

<p><i>Therapeutics</i>.&mdash;The external uses of the drug are mainly
analgesic. The liniment or plaster of belladonna will relieve
many forms of local pain. Generally speaking, it may be laid
down that atropine is more likely than iodine to relieve a pain
of quite superficial origin; and conversely. Totally to be
reprobated is the use, in order to relieve pain, of belladonna or
any other application which affects the skin, in cases where
the surgeon may later be required to operate. In such cases,
it is necessary to use such anodyne measures as will not interfere
with the subsequent demands that may be made of the skin,
<i>i.e.</i> that it be aseptic and in a condition so sound that it is able
to undertake the process of healing itself after the operation
has been performed. Atropine is universally and constantly
used in ophthalmic practice in order to dilate the pupil for
examination of the retina by the ophthalmoscope, or in cases
where the inflamed iris threatens to form adhesions to neighbouring
parts. The drug is often replaced in ophthalmology
by homatropine&mdash;an alkaloid prepared from tropine&mdash;which
acts similarly to atropine but has the advantage of allowing
the ocular changes to pass away in a much shorter time. The
anhidrotic action of atropine is largely employed in controlling
the night-sweats so characteristic of pulmonary tuberculosis,
small doses of the solution of the sulphate being given at night.</p>

<p>The uses of atropine in cardiac affections are still obscure
and dubious. It can only be laid down that the drug is a valuable
though temporary stimulant in emergencies, and that its use as
a plaster or internally often relieves cardiac pain. Recollection
of the extraordinary complexity of the problems which are
involved in the whole question of pain of cardiac origin will
emphasize the extreme vagueness of the above assertion. Professor
Schäfer recommended the use of atropine prior to the
administration of a general anaesthetic, in cases where the
action of the vagus nerve upon the heart is to be dreaded; and
there is little doubt of the value of this precaution, which has
no attendant disadvantages, in all such cases. Atropine is
often of value as an antidote, as in poisoning by pilocarpine,
muscarine (mushroom poisoning), prussic acid, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Omitting numerous minor applications of this drug, we may
pass to two therapeutic uses which are of unquestionable utility.
In cases of whooping-cough or any other condition in which
there is spasmodic action of the muscular fibre in the bronchi&mdash;a
definition which includes nearly every form of asthma and
many cases of bronchitis&mdash;atropine is an almost invaluable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page694" id="page694"></a>694</span>
drug. Not only does it relieve the spasm, but it lessens the
amount of secretion&mdash;often dangerously excessive&mdash;which is
often associated with it. The relief of symptoms in whooping-cough
is sharply to be distinguished from any influence on the
course of the disease, since the drug does not abbreviate its
duration by a single day. In treating an actual and present
attack of asthma, it is advisable to give the standardized tincture
of belladonna&mdash;unless expense is no consideration, in which
case atropine may itself be used&mdash;in doses of twenty minims
every quarter of an hour as long as no evil effects appear. Relief
is thereby constantly obtained. Smaller doses of the drug
should be given three times a day between the attacks.</p>

<p>The nocturnal enuresis or urinary incontinence of children
and of adults is frequently relieved by this drug. The excellent
toleration of atropine displayed by children must be remembered,
and if its use is &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; a cure may almost always be expected.</p>

<p><i>Toxicology.</i>&mdash;The symptoms of poisoning by belladonna or
atropine are dealt with above. The essential point here to be
added is that death takes place from combined cardiac and
respiratory failure. This fact is, of course, the key to treatment.
This consists in the use of emetics or the stomach-pump, with
lime-water, which decomposes the alkaloid. These measures are,
however, usually rendered nugatory by the very rapid absorption
of the alkaloid. Death is to be averted by such measures as will
keep the heart and lungs in action until the drug has been
excreted by the kidneys. Inject stimulants subcutaneously;
give coffee&mdash;hot and strong&mdash;by the mouth and rectum, or use
large doses of caffeine citrate; and employ artificial respiration.
Do not employ such physiological antagonists as pilocarpine
or morphine, for the lethal actions of all these drugs exhibit
not mutual antagonism but coincidence.</p>

the 25th of March 1850. He studied for a time at Union College,
Schenectady, New York, and in Germany; was admitted to the
bar in 1871; but soon engaged in newspaper work, first as an
associate editor of the <i>Springfield Union</i>, Mass., and then as an
editorial writer for the <i>New York Evening Post</i>. After publishing
three novelettes (<i>Six to One, Dr Heidenhoff&rsquo;s Process</i> and <i>Miss
Ludington&rsquo;s Sister</i>), pleasantly written and showing some inventiveness
in situation, but attracting no special notice, in 1888
he caught the public attention with <i>Looking Backward, 2000-1887</i>.
in which he set forth ideas of co-operative or semi-socialistic
life in village or city communities. The book was widely
circulated in America and Europe, and was translated into
several foreign languages. It was at first judged merely as a
romance, but was soon accepted as a statement of the deliberate
wishes and methods of its author, who devoted the remainder
of his life as editor, author, lecturer and politician, to the
promotion of the communistic theories of <i>Looking Backward</i>, which
he called &ldquo;nationalism&rdquo;; a Nationalist party (the main points
of whose immediate programme, according to Bellamy, were
embodied in the platform of the People&rsquo;s party of 1892) was
organized, but obtained no political hold. In 1897 Bellamy
published <i>Equality</i>, a sequel to <i>Looking Backward</i>.

<p><span class="bold">BELLAMY, GEORGE ANNE<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> (1727-1788), English actress,
born at Fingal, Ireland, by her own account, on the 23rd of
April 1733, but more probably in 1727, was the illegitimate
daughter of Lord Tyrawley, British ambassador at Lisbon.
Her mother married there a Captain Bellamy, and the child
received the name George Anne, by mistake for Georgiana.
Lord Tyrawley acknowledged the child, had her educated in a
convent in Boulogne, and through him she came to know a
number of notable people in London. On his appointment as
ambassador to Russia, she went to live with her mother in
London, made the acquaintance of Mrs Woffington and Garrick,
and adopted the theatrical profession. Her first engagement
was at Covent Garden as Monimia in the <i>Orphan</i> in 1744. Owing
to her personal charms and the social patronage extended to her,
her success was immediate, and till 1770 she acted in London,
Edinburgh and Dublin, in all the principal tragic roles. She
played Juliet to Garrick&rsquo;s Romeo at Drury Lane at the time that
Spranger Barry (<i>q.v.</i>) was giving the rival performances at Covent
Garden, and was considered the better of the Juliets. Her last
years were unhappy, and passed in poverty and ill-health. She

<p><span class="bold">BELLAMY, JOSEPH<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> (1719-1790), American theologian, was
born in Cheshire, Connecticut, on the 20th of February 1719.
He graduated from Yale in 1735, studied theology for a time
under Jonathan Edwards, was licensed to preach when scarcely
eighteen years old, and from 1740 until his death, on the 6th of
March 1790, was pastor of the Congregational church at Bethlehem,
Connecticut. The publication of his best-known work, <i>True
Religion Delineated</i> (1750), won for him a high reputation as a
theologian, and the book was several times reprinted both in
England and in America. Despite the fact that with the exception
of the period of the &ldquo;Great Awakening&rdquo; (1740-1742), when
he preached as an itinerant in several neighbouring colonies, his
active labours were confined to his own parish, his influence
on the religious thought of his time in America was probably
surpassed only by that of his old friend and teacher Jonathan
Edwards. This influence was due not only to his publications,
but also to the &ldquo;school&rdquo; or classes for the training of clergymen
which he conducted for many years at his home and from which
went forth scores of preachers to every part of New England and
the middle colonies (states). Bellamy&rsquo;s &ldquo;system&rdquo; of divinity
was in general similar to that of Edwards. During the War of
Independence he was loyal to the American cause. The university
of Aberdeen conferred upon him the honorary degree of D.D.
in 1768. He was a powerful and dramatic preacher. His
published works, in addition to that above mentioned, include
<i>The Wisdom of God in the Permission of Sin</i> (1758), his most
characteristic work; <i>Theron, Paulinus and Aspasio; or
Letters and Dialogues upon the Nature of Love to God, Faith in
Christ, and Assurance of a Title to Eternal Life</i> (1759); <i>The Nature
and Glory of the Gospel</i> (1762); <i>A Blow at the Root of Antinomianism</i>
(1763); <i>There is but One Covenant</i> (1769); <i>Four Dialogues on
the Half-Way Covenant</i> (1769); and <i>A Careful and Strict Examination
of the External Covenant</i> (1769).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His collected <i>Works</i> were published in 3 vols. (New York, 1811-1812),

<p><span class="bold">BELLARMINE<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> (Ital. <i>Bellarmino</i>), <b>ROBERTO FRANCESCO
ROMOLO</b> (1542-1621), Italian cardinal and theologian, was
born at Monte Pulciano, in Tuscany, on the 4th of October 1542.
He was destined by his father to a political career, but feeling
a call to the priesthood he entered the Society of Jesus in 1560
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page695" id="page695"></a>695</span>
After spending three years at Rome, he was sent to the Jesuit
settlement at Mondovi in Piedmont, where he studied and at
the same time taught Greek, and, though not yet in orders,
gained some reputation as a preacher. In 1567 and 1568 he
was at Padua, studying theology under a master who belonged
to the school of St Thomas Aquinas. In 1569 he was sent by the
general of his order to Louvain, and in 1570, after being ordained
priest, began to lecture on theology at the university. His
seven years&rsquo; residence in the Low Countries brought him into
close relations with modes of thought differing essentially from
his own; and, though he was neither by temperament nor
training inclined to be affected by the prevailing Augustinian
doctrines of grace and free-will, the controversy into which he
fell on these questions compelled him to define his theological
principles more clearly. On his return to Rome in 1576 he was
chosen by Gregory XIII. to lecture on controversial theology in
the newly-founded Roman College. The result of these labours
appeared some years afterwards in the far-famed <i>Disputationes
de Controversiis Christianae Fidei adversus hujus temporis
Haereticos</i> (3 vols., 1581, 1582, 1593). These volumes, which
called forth a multitude of answers on the Protestant side,
exhaust the controversy as it was carried on in those days,
and contain a lucid and uncompromising statement of Roman
Catholic doctrine. For many years afterwards, Bellarmine
was held by Protestant advocates as the champion of the papacy,
and a vindication of Protestantism generally took the form
of an answer to his works. In 1589 he was selected by Sixtus V.
to accompany, in the capacity of theologian, the papal legation
sent to France soon after the murder of Henry III. He was
created cardinal in 1599 by Clement VIII., and two years later
was made archbishop of Capua. His efforts on behalf of the
clergy were untiring, and his ideal of the bishop&rsquo;s office may
be read in his address to his nephew, Angelo della Ciaia, who
had been raised to the episcopate (<i>Admonitio ad episcopum
Theanensem, nepotem suum</i>, Rome, 1612). Being detained
in Rome by the desire of the newly-elected pope, Paul V., he
resigned his archbishopric in 1605. He supported the church
in its conflicts with the civil powers in Venice, France and
England, and sharply criticized James I. for the severe legislation
against the Roman Catholics that followed the discovery of the
Gunpowder Plot. When health failed him, he retired to Monte
Pulciano, where from 1607 to 1611 he acted as bishop. In 1610
he published his <i>De Potestate summi Pontificis in rebus temporalibus</i>
directed against the posthumous work of William Barclay of
Aberdeen, which denied the temporal power of the pope.
Bellarmine trod here on difficult ground, for, although maintaining
that the pope had the indirect right to depose unworthy
rulers, he gave offence to Paul V. in not asserting more strongly
the direct papal claim, whilst many French theologians, and
especially Bossuet, condemned him for his defence of ultramontanism.
As a <i>consultor</i> of the Sacred Office, Bellarmine
took a prominent part in the first examination of Galileo&rsquo;s
writings. His conduct in this matter has been constantly misrepresented.
He had followed with interest Galileo&rsquo;s scientific
discoveries and a respectful admiration grew up between them.
Bellarmine did not proscribe the Copernican system, as has
been maintained by Reusch (<i>Der Process Galilei&rsquo;s und die
Jesuiten</i>, Bonn, 1879, p. 125); all he claimed was that it should
be presented as an hypothesis until it should receive scientific
demonstration. When Galileo visited Rome in December 1615
he was warmly received by Bellarmine, and the high regard in
which he was held is clearly testified in Bellarmine&rsquo;s letters
and in Galileo&rsquo;s dedication to the cardinal of his discourse on
&ldquo;flying bodies.&rdquo; The last years of Bellarmine&rsquo;s life were mainly
devoted to the composition of devotional works and to securing
the papal approbation of the new order of the Visitation, founded
by his friend St Francis de Sales, and the beatification of St
Philip Neri. He died in Rome on the 17th of September 1621.
Bellarmine, whose life was a model of Christian virtue, is the
greatest of modern Roman Catholic controversialists, but the
value of his theological works is seriously impaired by a very
defective exegesis and a too frequent use of &ldquo;forced&rdquo; conclusions.
His devotional treatises were very popular among English
Roman Catholics in the penal days.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;Of the older editions of Bellarmine&rsquo;s complete
works the best is that in 7 vols. published at Cologne (1617-1620);
modern editions appeared in 8 vols. at Naples (1856-1862, reprinted
1872), and in 12 vols. at Paris (1870-1874). For complete bibliography

<p><span class="bold">BELLARY,<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Ballari</span>, a city and district of British India,
in the Madras presidency. The city is 305 m. by rail from Madras.
Pop. (1901) 58,247. The fort rises from a huge mass of granite
rock, which with a circumference of nearly 2 m., juts up abruptly
to a height of 450 ft. above the plain. The length of this rock
from north-east to south-west is about 1150 ft. To the E. and
S. lies an irregular heap of boulders, but to the W. is an unbroken
precipice, and the N. is walled by bare rugged ridges. It is
defended by two distinct lines of works. The upper fort is a
quadrangular building on the summit, with only one approach,
and was deemed impregnable by the Mysore princes. But as it
has no accommodation for a garrison, it is now only occupied by
a small guard of British troops in charge of prisoners. The ex-nawab
of Kurnool was confined in it for forty years for the
murder of his wife. It contains several cisterns, excavated in
the rock. Outside the turreted rampart are a ditch and covered
way. The lower fort lies at the eastern base of the rock and
measures about half a mile in diameter. It contains the barracks
and the commissariat stores, the Protestant church, orphanage,
Masonic lodge, post-office and numerous private dwellings.
The fort of Bellary was originally built by Hanumapa, in the 16th
century. It was first dependent on the kingdom of Vijayanagar,
afterwards on Bijapur, and subsequently subject to the nizam
and Hyder Ali. The latter erected the present fortifications
according to tradition with the assistance of a French engineer
in his service, whom he afterwards hanged for not building the
fort on a higher rock adjacent to it. Bellary is an important
cantonment and the headquarters of a military division. There
is a considerable trade in cotton, in connexion with which there
are large steam presses, and some manufacture of cotton cloth.
There is a cotton spinning mill. In 1901 Bellary was chosen as
one of the places of detention in India for Boer prisoners of war.</p>

<p>The district of <span class="sc">Bellary</span> has an area of 5714 sq. m. It
consists chiefly of an extensive plateau between the Eastern and
Western Ghats, of a height varying from 800 to 1000 ft. above
the sea. The most elevated tracts are on the west, where the
surface rises towards the culminating range of hills, and on the
south, where it rises to the elevated tableland of Mysore.
Towards the centre the almost treeless plain presents a monotonous
aspect, broken only by a few rocky elevations that rise
abruptly from the black soil. The hill ranges in Bellary are
those of Sandur and Kampli to the west, the Lanka Malla to the
east and the Copper Mountain (3148 ft.) to the south-west.
The district is watered by five rivers: the Tungabhadra,
formed by the junction of two streams, Tunga and Bhadra,
the Haggari, Hindri, Chitravati and Pennar, the last considered
sacred by the natives. None of the rivers is navigable and all
are fordable during the dry season. The climate of Bellary is
characterized by extreme dryness, due to the passing of the air
over a great extent of heated plains, and it has a smaller rainfall
than any other district in south India. The average daily
variation of the thermometer is from 67° to 83° F. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page696" id="page696"></a>696</span>
prevailing diseases are cholera, fever, small-pox, ophthalmia,
dysentery and those of the skin among the lower classes. Bellary
is subject to disastrous storms and hurricanes, and to famines
arising from a series of bad seasons. There were memorable
famines in 1751, 1793, 1803, 1833, 1854, 1866, 1877 and 1896.</p>

<p>In 1901 the population was 947,214, showing an increase of 8%
in the decade. The principal crops are millet, other food-grains,
pulse, oil-seeds and cotton. There are considerable manufactures
of cotton and woollen goods, and cotton is largely
exported. The district is traversed by the Madras and Southern
Mahratta railways, meeting on the eastern border at Guntakal
junction, where another line branches off to Bezwada.</p>

<p>Little is known of the early history of the district. It contains
the ruined capital of the ancient Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagar,
and on the overthrow of that state by the Mahommedans, in
1564, the tract now forming the district of Bellary was split up
into a number of military holdings, held by chiefs called poligars.
In 1635 the Carnatic was annexed to the Bijapur dominions,
from which again it was wrested in 1680 by Sivaji, the founder
of the Mahratta power. It was then included in the dominions
of Nizam-ul-mulk, the nominal viceroy of the great Mogul in the
Deccan, from whom again it was subsequently conquered by
Hyder Ali of Mysore. At the close of the war with Tippoo
Sultan in 1792, these territories fell to the share of the nizam of
Hyderabad, by whom they were ceded to the British in 1800,
in return for protection by a force of British troops to be stationed
at his capital. In 1808 the &ldquo;Ceded Districts,&rdquo; as they were
called, were split into two districts, Cuddapah and Bellary. In
1882 the district of Anantapur, which had hitherto formed part
of Bellary, was formed into a separate collectorate.</p>

one or more bells are hung in chapels or small churches
which have no towers. Bell-cots are sometimes double, as at
Northborough and Coxwell; a very common form in France and
Switzerland admits of three bells. In these countries also they
are frequently of wood and attached to the ridge. In later
times bell-turrets were much ornamented; on the continent of
Europe they run up into a sort of small, slender spire, called
<i>flèche</i> in France, and <i>guglio</i> in Italy. A bell-cot, gable or turret
often holds the &ldquo;Sanctus-bell,&rdquo; rung at the saying of the
&ldquo;Sanctus&rdquo; at the beginning of the canon of the Mass, and at
the consecration and elevation of the Elements in the Roman
Church. This differs but little from the common bell-cot,
except that it is generally on the top of the arch dividing the
nave from the chancel. At Cleeve, however, the bell seems to
have been placed in a cot outside the wall. Sanctus-bells have
also been placed over the gables of porches.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELLEAU, REMY<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1527-1577), French poet, and member
of the Pléiade (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Daurat</a></span>), was born at Nogent-le-Rotrou
about 1527. He studied with Ronsard and others under Jean
Daurat at the Collège de Coqueret. He was attached to Renè
de Lorraine, marquis d&rsquo;Elboeuf, in the expedition against Naples
in 1557, where he did good military service. On his return he
was made tutor to the young Charles, marquis d&rsquo;Elboeuf, who,
under Belleau&rsquo;s training became a great patron of the muses.
Belleau was an enthusiast for the new learning and joined the
group of young poets with ardour. In 1556 he published the
first translation of Anacreon which had appeared in French.
In the next year he published his first collection of poems, the
<i>Petites inventions</i>, in which he describes stones, insects and
flowers. The <i>Amours et nouveaux échanges des pierres précieuses</i>
... (1576) contains perhaps his most characteristic work. Its
title is quoted in the lines of Ronsard&rsquo;s epitaph on his tomb:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Luy mesme a basti son tombeau</p>
<p class="i05">Dedans ses Pierres Précieuses.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">He wrote commentaries to Ronsard&rsquo;s <i>Amours</i> in 1560, notes
which evinced delicate taste and prodigious learning. Like
Ronsard and Joachim Du Bellay, he was extremely deaf. His
days passed peacefully in the midst of his books and friends, and
he died on the 6th of March 1577. He was buried in the nave
of the Grands Augustins at Paris, and was borne to the tomb on
the pious shoulders of four poets, Ronsard, J.A. de Baïf, Philippe
Desportes and Amadis Jamyn. His most considerable work is
<i>La Bergerie</i> (1565-1572), a pastoral in prose and verse, written in
imitation of Sannazaro. The lines on April in the <i>Bergerie</i> are
well known to all readers of French poetry. Belleau was the
French Herrick, full of picturesqueness, warmth and colour. His
skies drop flowers and all his air is perfumed, and this voluptuous
sweetness degenerates sometimes into licence. Extremely
popular in his own age, he shared the fate of his friends, and
was undeservedly forgotten in the next. Regnier said: &ldquo;Belleau
ne parle pas comme on parle à la ville&rdquo;; and his lyrical beauty
was lost on the trim 17th century. His complete works were
collected in 1578, and contain, besides the works already
mentioned, a comedy entitled <i>La Reconnue</i>, in short rhymed lines,
which is not without humour and life, and a comic masterpiece,
a macaronic poem on the religious wars, <i>Dictamen metrificum de

1750, as Achilles in <i>Iphigénie</i> was not a great success. He soon
turned to more congenial comedy rôles, which for thirty years he
filled with great credit. He was a very natural player, and his
willingness to give others on the stage an opportunity to show
their talents made him extremely popular. He wrote a successful
play, <i>Fausses apparences</i> (1761), and was very useful to the
Comédie Française in editing and adapting the plays of others.
He died on the 19th of November 1778.</p>

<p>His wife, <span class="sc">Rose Perrine le Roy de la Corbinaye</span>, was born
at Lamballe on the 20th of December 1730, the daughter of an
artillery officer. Under the stage name of Beaumenard she
made her first Paris appearance in 1743 as Gogo in Favart&rsquo;s
<i>Le Coq du village</i>. After a year at the Opéra Comique she played
in several companies, including that of Marshal Saxe, who
is said to have been not insensible to her charms. In 1749 she
made her <i>début</i> at the Comédie Française as Dorine in <i>Tartuffe</i>,
and her success was immediate. She retired in 1756, but after
an absence of five years, during which she married, she reappeared
as Madame Bellecour, and continued her successes in soubrette
parts in the plays of Molière and de Regnard. She retired
finally at the age of sixty, but troublous times had put an end to
the pension which she received from Louis XVI. and from the
theatre, and she died in abject poverty on the 5th of August
1799. There is a charming portrait of her owned by the Théâtre
Français.</p>

and Louis XIII., was royal master of the horse and governor of
Burgundy. His estate of Seurre in Burgundy was created a
duchy in the peerage of France (<i>duché-pairie</i>) in his favour under
the name of Bellegarde, in 1619. In 1645 the title of this duchy
was transferred to the estate of Choisy-aux-Loges in Gâtinais,
and was borne later by the family of Pardaillan de Gondrin, heirs
of the house of Saint-Lary-Bellegarde. When Seurre passed
into the possession of the princes of Condé they in the same way
acquired the title of dukes of Bellegarde.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELLEGARDE, HEINRICH JOSEPH JOHANNES,<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span>
<span class="sc">Count von</span> (1756-1845), Austrian soldier and statesman, was born at
Dresden on the 29th of August 1756, and for a short time served
in the Saxon army. Transferring his services to Austria in 1771
he distinguished himself greatly as colonel of dragoons in the
Turkish War of 1788-1789, and served as a major-general in
the Netherlands campaigns of 1793-1794. In the campaign of
1796 in Germany, as a lieutenant field marshal, he served on
the staff of the archduke Charles, whom he accompanied to Italy
in the following year. He was also employed in the congress of
Rastatt. In 1799 he commanded a corps in eastern Switzerland,
connecting the armies of the archduke and Suvarov, and finally
joined the latter in north Italy. He conducted the siege of the
citadel of Alessandria, and was present at the decisive battle
of Novi. He served again in the latter part of the Marengo
campaign of 1800 in the rank of general of cavalry. In 1805,
when the archduke Charles left to take command in Italy,
Bellegarde became president <i>ad interim</i> of the council of war.
He was, however, soon employed in the field, and at the sanguinary
battle of Caldiero he commanded the Austrian right. In
the war of 1809 he commanded the extreme right wing of the
main army (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Napoleonic Campaigns</a></span>). Cut off from Charles
as the result of the battle of Eckmühl, he retreated into
Bohemia, but managed to rejoin before the great battles
near Vienna (Aspern and Wagram). From 1809 to 1813 Bellegarde,
now field marshal, was governor-general of Galicia, but
was often called to preside over the meetings of the Aulic
Council, especially in 1810 in connexion with the reorganization
of the Austrian army. In 1813, 1814 and 1815 he led the
Austrian armies in Italy. His successes in these campaigns
were diplomatic as well as military, and he ended them by
crushing the last attempt of Murat in 1815. From 1816 to 1825
(when he had to retire owing to failing eyesight) he held various
distinguished civil and military posts. He died in 1845.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELLE-ÎLE-EN-MER,<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> an island off the W. coast of France,
forming a canton of the department of Morbihan, 8 m. S. by W. of
the peninsula of Quiberon. Pop. (1906) 9703. Area, 33 sq. m.
The island is divided into the four communes of Le Palais,
Bangor, Sauzon and Locmaria. It forms a treeless plateau with
an average height of 130 ft. above sea-level, largely covered
with moors and bordered by a rugged and broken coast. The
climate is mild, the fig-tree and myrtle growing in sheltered spots
and the soil, where cultivated, is productive. The inhabitants
are principally engaged in agriculture and the fisheries, and in
the preservation of sardines, anchovies, &amp;c. The breed of draught
horses in the island is highly prized. The chief town, Le Palais
(pop. 2637), has an old citadel and fortifications, and possesses a
port which is accessible to vessels drawing 13 ft. of water.
Belle-Île must have been inhabited from a very early period,
as it possesses several stone monuments of the class usually
called Druidic.</p>

<p>The Roman name of the island seems to have been <i>Vindilis</i>,
which in the middle ages became corrupted to Guedel. In 1572
the monks of the abbey of Ste Croix at Quimperlé ceded the
island to the Retz family, in whose favour it was raised to a
marquisate in the following year. It subsequently came into
the hands of the family of Fouquet, and was ceded by the latter
to the crown in 1718. It was held by English troops from 1761
to 1763 when the French got it in exchange for Nova Scotia.
A few of the inhabitants of the latter territory migrated to
Belle-Île, which is partly peopled by their descendants. In
the state prison of Nouvelle Force at Le Palais political prisoners
have at various times been confined.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELLE-ISLE, CHARLES LOUIS AUGUSTE FOUQUET,<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span>
<span class="sc">Comte</span>, and later <span class="sc">Duc, de</span> (1684-1761), French soldier and
statesman, was the grandson of Nicholas Fouquet, superintendent
of finances under Louis XIV., and was born at Villefranche
de Rouergue. Although his family was in disgrace, he entered
the army at an early age and was made proprietary colonel of a
dragoon regiment in 1708. He rose during the War of the Spanish
Succession to the rank of brigadier, and in March 1718 to that
of <i>maréchal de camp</i>. In the Spanish War of 1718-1719 he was
present at the capture of Fontarabia in 1718 and at that of St
Sebastian in 1719. When the duke of Bourbon became prime
minister, Belle-Isle was imprisoned in the Bastille, and then
relegated to his estates, but with the advent of Cardinal Fleury
to power he regained some measure of favour and was made
a lieutenant-general. In the War of the Polish Succession he
commanded a corps under the orders of Marshal Berwick, captured
Trier and Trarbach and took part in the siege of Philippsburg
(1734). When peace was made in 1736 the king, in recognition
both of his military services and of the part he had taken
in the negotiations for the cession of Lorraine, gave him the
government of the three important fortresses of Metz, Toul
and Verdun&mdash;an office which he kept till his death. His
military and political reputation was now at its height, and he
was one of the principal advisers of the government in military
and diplomatic affairs. In 1741 he was sent to Germany as
French plenipotentiary to carry out, in the interests of France,
a grand scheme of political reorganization in the moribund
empire, and especially to obtain the election of Charles, elector
of Bavaria, as emperor. His diplomacy was thus the mainspring
of the War of the Austrian Succession (<i>q.v.</i>), and his military
command in south Germany was full of incidents and vicissitudes.
He had been named marshal of France in 1741, and received a
large army, with which it is said that he promised to make
peace in three months under the walls of Vienna. The truth of
this story is open to question, for no one knew better than Belle-Isle
the limitations imposed upon commanders by the military
and political circumstances of the times. These circumstances
in fact rendered his efforts, both as a general and as a statesman,
unavailing, and the one redeeming feature in the general failure
was his heroic retreat from Prague. In ten days he led 14,000
men into and across the Bohemian Forest, suffering great privations
and harassed by the enemy, but never allowing himself
to be cut off, and his subordinate Chevert defended Prague so
well that the Austrians were glad to allow him to rejoin his
chief. The campaign, however, had discredited Belle-Isle;
he was ridiculed at Paris by the wits and the populace, even
Fleury is said to have turned against him, and, to complete his
misfortunes, he was taken prisoner by the English in going
from Cassel to Berlin through Hanover. He remained a year
in England, in spite of the demands of Louis XV. and of the
emperor Charles VII. During the campaign of 1746 he was
in command of the &ldquo;Army of Piedmont&rdquo; on the Alpine frontier,
and although he began his work with a demoralized and inferior
army, he managed not only to repel the invasion of the Spanish
and Italian forces but also to carry the war back into the plain
of Lombardy. At the peace, having thus retrieved his military
reputation, he was created duke and peer of France (1748).
In 1757 his credit at court was considerable, and the king named
him secretary for war. During his three years&rsquo; ministry he undertook
many reforms, such as the development of the military
school for officers, and the suppression of the proprietary
colonelcies of nobles who were too young to command; and he
instituted the Order of Merit. But the Seven Years&rsquo; War was
by that time in progress and his efforts had no immediate effect.
He died at Versailles on the 26th of January 1761. Belle-Isle
interested himself in literature; was elected a member of the
French Academy in 1740, and founded the Academy of Metz
in 1760. The dukedom ended with his death, his only son
having been killed in 1758 at the battle of Crefeld.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page698" id="page698"></a>698</span></p>

<p>His brother, <span class="sc">Louis Charles Armand Fouquet</span>, known as
the Chevalier de Belle-Isle (1693-1746), was also a soldier and
a diplomatist. He served as a junior officer in the War of the
Spanish Succession and as brigadier in the campaign of 1734
on the Rhine and Moselle, where he won the grade of <i>maréchal
de camp</i>. He was employed under his brother in political
missions in Bavaria and in Swabia in 1741-1742, became a
lieutenant-general, fought in Bohemia, Bavaria and the Rhine
countries in 1742-1743, and was arrested and sent to England
with the marshal in 1744. On his release he was given a command
in the Army of Piedmont. He fell a victim to his romantic
bravery at the action of Exilles (Col de l&rsquo;Assiette) on the 19th
of July 1746.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELLE ISLE, STRAIT OF,<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> the more northern of the two
channels connecting the Gulf of St Lawrence with the Atlantic
Ocean. It separates northern Newfoundland from Labrador,
and extends N.E. and S.W. for 35 m., with a breadth

communication with the mainland is kept up by wireless telegraphy.
The strait is in the most direct route from Europe

November, and even during this period navigation is often
rendered dangerous by floating ice and fogs. Through it Jacques
Cartier sailed in 1534. The southern or Cabot Strait, between
Cape Ray in Newfoundland and Cape North in Cape Breton,

1533-1587), Scottish writer, was born about the end of the
15th century, in the south-east of Scotland, perhaps in East
Lothian. He appears to have been educated, first at the university
of St Andrews and then at that of Paris, where he took, the
degree of doctor. From his own statement, in one of his poems,
we learn that he had been in the service of James V. from the
king&rsquo;s earliest years, and that the post he held was clerk of
accounts. At the request of James he undertook translations of
Boece&rsquo;s <i>Historia Scotorum</i>, which had appeared at Paris in 1527,
and the first five books of Livy. As a reward for his versions,
which he finished in 1533, he was appointed archdeacon of
Moray and a canon of Ross. He was a strenuous opponent of
the Reformation and was compelled to go into exile. He is said
by some authorities to have died at Rome in 1550; by others
to have been still living in 1587. His translation of Boece,
entitled <i>The History and Chronicles of Scotland</i>, is a remarkable
specimen of Scottish prose, distinguished by its freedom and
vigour of expression. It was published in 1536; and was
reprinted in 2 vols., edited by Maitland, in 1821. The translation
of Livy was not printed till 1822 (also in 2 vols.). Two MSS. of
the latter are extant, one, the older, in the Advocates&rsquo; library,
Edinburgh (which was the basis of the normalized text of 1822),
the other (<i>c.</i> 1550) in the possession of Mr Ogilvie Forbes of
Boyndlie. An edition of the work was edited for the Scottish
Text Society by Mr W.A. Craigie (2 vols. 1901, 1903). The
second volume of this edition contains also a complete reprint
of the portions of the holograph first draft which were discovered
in the British Museum in 1902. Two poems by Bellenden&mdash;<i>The
Proheme to the Cosmographe</i> and the <i>Proheme of the History</i>&mdash;appeared
in the 1536 edition of the <i>History of Scotland</i>. Others,
bearing his name in the well-known Bannatyne MS. collection,
made by his namesake George Bannatyne (<i>q.v.</i>), may or may not
be his. Sir David Lyndsay, in his prologue to the <i>Papyngo</i>,
speaks vaguely of:</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELLENDEN, WILLIAM,<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> Scottish classical scholar. Hardly
anything is known of him. He lived in the reign of James I.
(VI. of Scotland), who appointed him <i>magister libellorum supplicum</i>
or master of requests. King James is also said to have provided
Bellenden with the means of living independently at Paris,
where he became professor at the university, and advocate in
the parliament. The date of his birth cannot be fixed, and it
can only be said that he died later than 1625. The first of the
works by which he is known was published anonymously in 1608,
with the title <i>Ciceronis Princeps</i>, a laborious compilation of all
Cicero&rsquo;s remarks on the origin and principles of regal government,
digested and systematically arranged. In 1612 there appeared
a similar work, devoted to the consideration of consular authority
and the Roman senate, <i>Ciceronis Consul, Senator, Senatusque
Romanus</i>. His third work, <i>De Statu Prisci Orbls</i>, 1615, is a
good outline of general history. All three works were combined
in a single large volume, entitled <i>De Statu Libri Tres</i>, 1615, which
was first brought into due notice by Dr Samuel Parr, who, in
1787, published an edition with a preface, famous for the elegance
of its Latinity, in which he eulogized Burke, Fox and Lord
North as the &ldquo;three English luminaries.&rdquo; The greatest of
Bellenden&rsquo;s works is the extensive treatise <i>De Tribus Luminibus
Romanorum</i>, printed and published posthumously at Paris in
1633. The book is unfinished, and treats only of the first
luminary, Cicero; the others intended were apparently Seneca
and Pliny. It contains a most elaborate history of Rome and
its institutions, drawn from Cicero, and thus forms a storehouse
of all the historical notices contained in that voluminous author.
It is said that nearly all the copies were lost on the passage to
England. One of the few that survived was placed in the university
library at Cambridge, and freely drawn upon by Conyers
Middieton, the librarian, in his <i>History of the Life of Cicero</i>.
Both Joseph Warton and Dr Parr accused Middleton of deliberate
plagiarism, which was the more likely to have escaped detection
owing to the small number of existing copies of Bellenden&rsquo;s work.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BELLEROPHON,<a name="ar119" id="ar119"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Bellerophontes</span>, in Greek legend,
son of Glaucus or Poseidon, grandson of Sisyphus and local hero
of Corinth. Having slain by accident the Corinthian hero
Bellerus (or, according to others, his own brother) he fled to
Tiryns, where his kinsman Proetus, king of Argos, received him
hospitably and purged him of his guilt. But Anteia (or Stheneboea),
wife of Proetus, became enamoured of Bellerophon, and,
when he refused her advances, charged him with an attempt
upon her virtue. Proetus thereupon sent him to Iobates, his
wife&rsquo;s father, king of Lycia, with a letter or sealed tablet, in
which were instructions, apparently given by means of signs, to
take the life of the bearer. Arriving in Lycia, he was received
as a guest and entertained for nine days. On the tenth, being
asked the object of his visit, he handed the letter to the king,
whose first plan for complying with it was to send him to slay
the Chimaera, a monster which was devastating the country.
Bellerophon, mounted on Pegasus (<i>q.v.</i>), kept up in the air out of the
way of the Chimaera, but yet near enough to kill it with his spear,
or, as he is at other times represented, with his sword or with a bow.
He was next ordered out against the Solymi, a hostile tribe, and
afterwards against the Amazons, from both of which expeditions
he not only returned victorious, but also on his way back slew
an ambush of chosen warriors whom Iobates had placed to
intercept him. His divine origin was now proved; the king
gave him his daughter in marriage; and the Lycians presented
him with a large and fertile estate on which he lived (Apollodorus,
ii. 3; Homer, <i>Iliad</i>, vi. 155). Bellerophon is said to have
returned to Tiryns and avenged himself on Anteia: he persuaded
her to fly with him on his winged horse, and then flung her into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page699" id="page699"></a>699</span>
the sea near the island of Melos (Schol. Aristoph., <i>Pax</i>, 140).
His ambitious attempt to ascend to the heavens on Pegasus
brought upon him the wrath of the gods. His son was smitten
by Ares in battle; his daughter Laodameia was slain by Artemis;
he himself, flung from his horse, lamed or blinded, became a
wanderer over the face of the earth until his death (Pindar,
<i>Isthmia</i>, vi. [vii.], 44; Horace, <i>Odes</i>, iv. 11, 26).
Bellerophon was honoured as a hero at Corinth and in Lycia.
His story formed the subject of the <i>Debates</i> of Sophocles,
and of the <i>Bellerophontes</i> and <i>Stheneboea</i> of Euripides.
It has been suggested that Perseus, the local hero of Argos, and Bellerophon
were originally one and the same, the difference in their exploits being the
result of the rivalry of Argos and Corinth. Both are connected
with the sun-god Helios and with the sea-god Poseidon, the
symbol of the union being the winged horse Pegasus. Bellerophon
has been explained as a hero of the storm, of which his conflict
with the Chimaera is symbolical. The most frequent representations
of Bellerophon in ancient art are (1) slaying the Chimaera,
(2) departing from Argos with the letter, (3) leading Pegasus to
drink. Among the first is to be noted a terra-cotta relief from
Melos in the British Museum, where also, on a vase of black ware,
is what seems to be a representation of his escape from Stheneboea.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELLEY,<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> a town of eastern France, capital of an arrondissement
in the department of Ain, 52 m. S.E. of Bourg by
the Paris-Lyon railway. Pop. (1906), town, 3709; commune,
5707. It is situated on vine-covered hills at the southern
extremity of the Jura, 3 m. from the right bank of the Rhone.
Apart from the cathedral of St Jean, which, with the exception
of the choir of 1413, is a modern building, there is little of
architectural interest in the town. Belley is the seat of a bishopric
and a prefect, and has a tribunal of first instance. The
manufacture of morocco leather goods and the quarrying of the
lithographic stone of the vicinity are carried on, and there is
trade in cattle, grain, wine, truffles and dressed pork. Belley
is of Roman origin, and in the 5th century became an episcopal
see. It was the capital of the province of Bugey, which was a
dependency of Savoy till 1601, when it was ceded to France.
In 1385 the town was almost entirely destroyed by an act of
incendiarism, but was subsequently rebuilt by the dukes of
Savoy, who surrounded it with ramparts of which little is left.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELLIGERENCY,<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> the state of carrying on war (Lat. <i>bellum</i>,
war, and <i>gerere</i>, to wage) in accordance with the law of nations.
Insurgents are not as such excluded from recognition as belligerents,
and, even where not recognized as belligerents by the
government against which they have rebelled, they may be so
recognized by a neutral state, as in the case of the American
Civil War, when the Southern states were recognized as
belligerents by Great Britain, though regarded as rebels by the
Northern states. The recognition by a neutral state of
belligerency does not, however, imply recognition of independent
political existence. The regulations annexed to the Hague
Convention, relating to the laws and customs of war (29th of July
1899), contain a section entitled &ldquo;Belligerents&rdquo; which is
divided into three chapters, dealing respectively with (i.) The
Qualifications of Belligerents; (ii.) Prisoners of War; (iii.) The
Sick and Wounded. To entitle troops to the special privileges
attaching to belligerency, chapter i. provides that all regular,
militia or volunteer forces shall alike be commanded by persons
responsible for the acts of their men, that all such shall carry
distinctive emblems, recognizable at a distance, that arms shall
be carried openly and operations conducted in accordance with
the usages of war observed among civilized mankind. It provides,
nevertheless, for the emergency of the population of a territory,
which has not already been occupied by the invader, spontaneously
taking up arms to resist the invading forces, without
having had time to comply with the above requirements; they,
too, are to be treated as belligerents &ldquo;if they respect the laws
and customs of war.&rdquo; In naval war, privateering having been
finally abolished as among the parties to it by the declaration
of Paris, a privateer is not entitled, as between such parties,
to the rights of belligerency. As between states, one of whom
is not a party to the Declaration, the right to grant letters of
marque would remain intact for both parties, and the privateer,
<i>as between them</i>, would be a belligerent; as regards neutrals,
the situation would be complicated (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Privateer</a></span>). On

U.S.A., on the E. side of Bellingham Bay, 96 m. N. of Seattle.
Pop. (1900) 11,062; (1905, state est.) 26,000; (1910, U.S. census)
24,298. Area about 23 sq. m. It is served by the Great
Northern, the Northern Pacific, the Canadian Pacific, and
the Bellingham Bay &amp; British Columbia railways&mdash;being a
terminus of the last named, which operates only 62 m. of line
and connects with the Mt. Baker goldfields and the Nooksack
valley farm and orchard region. A suburban electric line was
projected in 1907. About 2½ m. south-east of the city is the
main body of Lake Whatcom, 13 m. long, 1¼ m. wide, and 318 ft.
higher than the city and the source of its water-supply, a gravity
system which cost $1,000,000, being owned by the city. Bellingham
has two Carnegie libraries. Among the principal buildings
are the county court-house, the city hall, the Young Men&rsquo;s
Christian Association building, and Beck&rsquo;s theatre, with a
seating capacity of 2200. The largest of the state&rsquo;s normal
colleges is situated here; in 1907 it had a faculty of 25 and
350 students; there are two high schools, two business colleges,
and one industrial school also in the city. The excellent harbour,
and the fact that Bellingham is nearer to the great markets of
Alaska than any other city in the states, make the port an important
shipping centre. In the value of manufactured product
the city was fourth in the state in 1905 (being passed only by
Tacoma, Seattle and Spokane), with a value of $3,293,988;
according to a census taken by the local chamber of commerce
the value of the product in 1906 was $7,751,464. The principal
industrial establishments are shingle (especially cedar) and
saw-mills, salmon canneries and factories for the manufacture
of tin cans, and machinery used in the canning of salmon. Motive
and electric lighting power is brought 52 m. from the falls
of the north fork of the Nooksack river, where there is a power
plant which furnishes 3500 horsepower. There are deposits
of clay and limestone in the surrounding country, and cement
is manufactured in the vicinity of the city. The blue-grey
Chuckanut sandstone is quarried on the shore of Chuckanut
Bay, south of Bellingham; and a coarse, dark-brown sandstone
is quarried on Sucia Island, west of the city. There are quarries
also on Waldron Island. Bellingham was formed in 1903 by
the consolidation of the cities of New Whatcom (pop. in 1900,
6834) and Fairhaven (pop. in 1900, 4228), and was chartered
as a city of the first class in 1904; it is named from Bellingham
Bay, which Vancouver is supposed to have named, in 1792,
in honour of Sir Henry Bellingham.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BELLINI,<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span> the name of a family of craftsmen in Venice, three
members of which fill a great place in the history of the Venetian
school of painting in the 15th century and the first years of the 16th.</p>

<p>I. <span class="sc">Jacopo Bellini</span> (<i>c.</i> 1400-1470-71) was the son of a tinsmith
or pewterer, Nicoletto Bellini, by his wife Franceschina.
When the accomplished Umbrian master Gentile da Fabriano
came to practise at Venice, where art was backward, several
young men of the city took service under him as pupils. Among
these were Giovanni and Antonio of Murano and Jacopo Bellini.
Gentile da Fabriano left Venice for Florence in 1422, and the
two brothers of Murano stayed at home and presently founded
a school of their own (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vivarini</a></span>). But Jacopo Bellini followed
his teacher to Florence, where the vast progress lately made,
alike in truth to natural fact and in sense of classic grace and style,
by masters like Donatello and Ghiberti, Masaccio and Paolo
Uccello, offered him better instruction than he could obtain even
from his Umbrian teacher. But his position as assistant to
Gentile brought him into trouble. As a stranger coming to
practise in Florence, Gentile was jealously looked on. One day
some young Florentines threw stones into his shop, and the
Venetian pupil ran out and drove them off with his fists. Thinking
this might be turned against him, he went and took service on
board the galleys of the Florentine state; but returning after a
year, found he had in his absence been condemned and fined for
assault. He was arrested and imprisoned, but the matter was
soon compromised, Jacopo submitting to a public act of penance
and his adversary renouncing further proceedings. Whether
Jacopo accompanied his master to Rome in 1426 we cannot
tell; but by 1429 we find him settled at Venice and married
to a wife from Pesaro named Anna (family name uncertain),
who in that year made a will in favour of her first child then
expected. She survived, however, and bore her husband two
sons, Gentile and Giovanni (though some evidences have been
thought to point rather to Giovanni having been his son by another
mother), and a daughter Nicolosia. In 1436 Jacopo was at
Verona, painting a Crucifixion in fresco for the chapel of S.
Nicholas in the cathedral (destroyed by order of the archbishop
in 1750, but the composition, a vast one of many figures, has been
preserved in an old engraving). Documents ranging from 1437
to 1465 show him to have been a member of the Scuola or mutual
aid society of St John the Evangelist at Venice, for which he
painted at an uncertain date a series of eighteen subjects of the
Life of the Virgin, fully described by Ridolfi but now destroyed
or dispersed. In 1439 we find him buying a panel of tarsia work
at the sale of the effects of the deceased painter Jacobello del
Fiore, and in 1440 entering into a business partnership with
another painter of the city called Donato. About this time he
must have paid a visit to the court of Ferrara, where there
prevailed a spirit of free culture and humanism most congenial
to his tastes. Pisanello, the first great naturalist artist of north
Italy, whose influence on Jacopo at the outset of his career had
been only second to that of Gentile da Fabriano, had been some
time engaged on a portrait of Leonello d&rsquo;Este, the elder son of
the reigning marquis Niccolo III. Jacopo (according to an almost
contemporary sonneteer) competed with a rival portrait, which
was declared by the father to be the better of the two. In the
next year, the last of the marquis Niccolo&rsquo;s life, we find him
making the successful painter a present of two bushels of wheat.
The relations thus begun with the house of Este seem to have been
kept up, and among Jacopo&rsquo;s extant drawings are several that
seem to belong to the scheme of a monument erected to the
memory of the marquis Niccolo ten years later. He was also
esteemed and employed by Sigismondo Malatesta at the court
of Rimini. In 1443 Jacopo took as an articled pupil a nephew
whom he had brought up from charity; in 1452 he painted a
banner for the Scuola of St Mary of Charity at Venice, and the
next year received a grant from the confraternity for the marriage
of his daughter Nicolosia with Andrea Mantegna, a marriage
which had the effect of transferring the gifted young Paduan
master definitively from the following of Squarcione to that
of Bellini. In 1456 he painted a figure of Lorenzo Giustiniani,
first patriarch of Venice, for his monument in San Pietro de
Castello, and in 1457, with a son for salaried assistant, three
figures of saints in the great hall of the patriarch. For some
time about these years Jacopo and his family would seem to
have resided at, or at least to have paid frequent visits to Padua,
where he is reported to have carried out works now lost, including
an altar-piece painted with the assistance of his sons in 1459-1460
for the Gattamelata chapel in the Santo, and several portraits
which are described by 16th-century witnesses but have disappeared.
At Venice he painted a Calvary for the Scuola of St Mark (1466).
His activity can be traced in documents down to August 1470, but in
November 1471 his wife Anna describes herself as his relict, so
that he must have died some time in the interval.</p>

<p>The above are all the facts concerning the life of Jacopo
Bellini which can be gathered from printed and documentary
records. The materials which have reached posterity for a
critical judgment on his work consist of four or five pictures only,
together with two important and invaluable books of drawings.
These prove him to have been a worthy third, following the
Umbrian Gentile da Fabriano and the Veronese Pisanello, in
that trio of remarkable artists who in the first half of the 15th
century carried towards maturity the art of painting in Venice
and the neighbouring cities. Of his pictures, an important
signed example is a life-size Christ Crucified in the archbishop&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page701" id="page701"></a>701</span>
palace at Verona. The rest are almost all Madonnas: two
signed, one in the Tadini gallery at Lovere, another in the
Venice academy; a third, unsigned and long ascribed in error to
Gentile da Fabriano, in the Louvre, with the portrait of Sigismondo
Malatesta as donor; a fourth, richest of all in colour and
ornamental detail, recently acquired from private hands for the
Uffizi at Florence. Plausibly, though less certainly, ascribed to
him are a fifth Madonna at Bergamo, a warrior-saint on horseback
(San Crisogono) in the church of San Trovaso at Venice, a Crucifixion
in the Museo Correr, and an Adoration of the Magi in
private possession at Ferrara. Against this scanty tale of
paintings we have to set an abundance of drawings and studies
preserved in two precious albums in the British Museum and the
Louvre. The former, which is the earlier in date, belonged to
the painter&rsquo;s elder son Gentile and was by him bequeathed to
his brother Giovanni. It consists of ninety-nine paper pages,
all drawn on both back and front with a lead point, an instrument
unusual at this date. Two or three of the drawings have been
worked over in pen; of the remainder many have become dim
from time and rubbing. The album at the Louvre, discovered
in 1883 in the loft of a country-house in Guienne, is equally rich
and better preserved, the drawings being all highly finished in
pen, probably over effaced preliminary sketches in chalk or lead.
The range of subjects is much the same in both collections, and
in both extremely varied, proving Jacopo to have been a craftsman
of many-sided curiosity and invention. He passes indiscriminately
from such usual Scripture scenes as the Adoration
of the Magi, the Agony in the Garden, and the Crucifixion, to
designs from classic fable, copies from ancient bas-reliefs, stories
of the saints, especially St Christopher and St George, the latter
many times repeated (he was the patron saint of the house of
Este), fanciful allegories of which the meaning has now become
obscure, scenes of daily life, studies for monuments, and studies
of animals, especially of eagles (the emblem of the house of Este),
horses and lions. He loves to marshal his figures in vast open
spaces, whether of architecture or mountainous landscape. In
designing such spaces and in peopling them with figures of
relatively small scale, we see him eagerly and continually putting
to the test the principles of the new science of perspective. His
castellated and pinnacled architecture, in a mixed medieval and
classical spirit, is elaborately thought out, and scarcely less so his
groups and ranges of barren hills, broken in clefts or ascending
in spiral terraces. With a predilection for tall and slender
proportions, he draws the human figure with a flowing generalized
grace and no small freedom of movement; but he does not
approach either in mastery of line or in vehemence of action a
Florentine draughtsman such as Antonio Pollaiuolo. Jacopo&rsquo;s
influence on the development of Venetian art was very great,
not only directly through his two sons and his son-in-law Mantegna,
but through other and independent contemporary workshops
of the city, in none of which did it remain unfelt.</p>

<p>II. <span class="sc">Gentile Bellini</span> (1429-1430-1507), the elder son of
Jacopo, first appears independently as the painter of a Madonna,
much in his father&rsquo;s manner, dated 1460, and now in the Berlin
museum. We have seen how in the previous year he and his
brother assisted their father in the execution of an altar-piece
for the Santo at Padua. In July 1466 we find him contracting
with the officers of the Scuola of St Mark as an independent
artist to decorate the doors of their organ. These paintings still
exist in a blackened condition. They represent four saints,
colossal in size, and designed with much of the harsh and searching
austerity which characterized the Paduan school under Squarcione.
In December of the same year Gentile bound himself to
execute for the great hall of the same company two subjects of
the Exodus, to be done better than, or at least as well as, his
father&rsquo;s work in the same place. These paintings have perished.
For the next eight years the history of Gentile&rsquo;s life and work
remains obscure. But he must have risen steadily in the esteem
of his fellow-citizens, since in 1474 we find him commissioned
by the senate to restore, renew, and when necessary replace, the
series of paintings, the work of an earlier generation of artists,
which were perishing from damp on the walls of the Hall of the
Great Council in the ducal palace. This was evidently intended
to be a permanent employment, and in payment the painter was
to receive the reversion of a broker&rsquo;s stall in the Fondaco dei
Tedeschi; a lucrative form of sinecure frequently allotted to
artists engaged for tasks of long duration. In continuation of
this work Gentile undertook a series of independent paintings
on subjects of Venetian history for the same hall, but had
apparently only finished one, representing the delivery of the
consecrated candle by the pope to the doge, when his labours
were interrupted by a mission to the East. The sultan
Mahommed II. had despatched a friendly embassy to Venice,
inviting the doge to visit him at Constantinople and at the same
time requesting the despatch of an excellent painter to work at
his court. The former part of the sultan&rsquo;s proposal the senate
declined, with the latter they complied; and Gentile Bellini with
two assistants was selected for the mission, his brother Giovanni
being at the same time appointed to fill his place on the works
for the Hall of the Great Council. Gentile gave great satisfaction
to the sultan, and returned after about a year with a knighthood,
some fine clothes, a gold chain and a pension. The surviving
fruits of his labours at Constantinople consist of a large painting
representing the reception of an ambassador in that city, now in
the Louvre; a highly finished portrait of the sultan himself, now
one of the treasures, despite its damaged condition, of the
collection of the late Sir Henry Layard; an exquisitely wrought
small portrait in water-colour of a scribe, found in 1905 by a
private collector in the bazaar at Constantinople and now in the
collection of Mrs Gardner at Boston; and two pen-and-ink
drawings of Turkish types, now in the British Museum. Early
copies of two or three other similar drawings are preserved in
the Städel Institute at Frankfurt; such copies may have been
made for the use of Gentile&rsquo;s Umbrian contemporary, Pinturicchio,
who introduced figures borrowed from them into
some of his decorative frescoes in the Appartamento Borgia
at Rome.</p>

<p>A place had been left open for Gentile to continue working
beside his brother Giovanni (with whom he lived always on terms
of the closest amity) in the ducal palace; and soon after 1480
he began to carry out his share in the great series of frescoes,
unfortunately destroyed by fire in 1577, illustrating the part
played by Venice in the struggles between the papacy and the
emperor Barbarossa. These works were executed not on the
wall itself but on canvas (the climate of Venice having so
many times proved fatal to wall paintings), and probably in oil,
a method which all the artists of Venice, following the example
set by Antonello da Messina, had by this time learnt or were
learning to practise. The subjects allotted to Gentile, in addition
to the above-mentioned presentation of the consecrated candle,
were as follows: the departure of the Venetian ambassadors
to the court of Barbarossa, Barbarossa receiving the ambassadors,
the pope inciting the doge and senate to war, the pope bestowing
a sword and his blessing on the doge and his army (a drawing in
the British Museum purports to be the artist&rsquo;s original sketch
for this composition), and according to some authorities also the
gift of the symbolic ring by the pope to the victorious doge on
his return. These works received the highest praise both from
contemporary and from later Venetian critics, but no fragment
of them survived the fire of 1577. Their character can to some
extent be judged by a certain number of kindred historical and
processional works by the same hand which have been preserved.
Of such the Academy at Venice has three which were painted
between 1490 and 1500 for the Scuola of St John the Evangelist,
and represent certain events connected with a famous relic
belonging to the Scuola, namely, a supposed fragment of the
true cross. All have been, much injured and re-painted; nevertheless
one at least, showing the procession of the relic through
St Mark&rsquo;s Place and the thanksgiving of a father who owed to
it the miraculous cure of his son, still gives a good idea of the
painter&rsquo;s powers and style. Great accuracy and firmness of
individual portraiture, a strong gift, derived no doubt from his
father&rsquo;s example, for grouping and marshalling a crowd of
personages in spaces of fine architectural perspective, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page702" id="page702"></a>702</span>
severity and dryness of the Paduan manner much mitigated by
the dawning splendour of true Venetian colour&mdash;these are the
qualities that no injury has been able to deface. They are again
manifest in an interesting Adoration of the Magi in the Layard
collection; and reappear still more forcibly in the last work
undertaken by the artist, the great picture now at the Brera in
Milan of St Mark preaching at Alexandria; this was commissioned
by the Scuola of St Mark in March 1505, and left by the artist
in his will, dated 18th of February 1507, to be finished by his
brother Giovanni. Of single portraits by this artist, who was
almost as famous for them as for processional groups, there
survive one of a doge at the Museo Correr in Venice, one of
Catarina Cornaro at Budapest, one of a mathematician at the
National Gallery, another of a monk in the same gallery, signed
wrongly to all appearance with the name of Giovanni Bellini,
besides one or two others in private hands. The features of
Gentile himself are known from a portrait medallion by Camelio,
and can be recognized in two extant drawings, one at Berlin
supposed to be by the painter&rsquo;s own hand, and another, much
larger and more finished, at Christ Church, Oxford, which is
variously attributed to Bonsignori and A. Vivarini.</p>

<p>III. <span class="sc">Giovanni Bellini</span> (1430-1431-1516) is generally
assumed to have been the second son of Jacopo by his wife Anna;
though the fact that she does not mention him in her will with
her other sons has thrown some slight doubt upon the matter.
At any rate he was brought up in his father&rsquo;s house, and always
lived and worked in the closest fraternal relation with Gentile.
Up till the age of nearly thirty we find documentary evidence
of the two sons having served as their father&rsquo;s assistants in
works both at Venice and Padua. In Giovanni&rsquo;s earliest independent
works we find him more strongly influenced by the
harsh and searching manner of the Paduan school, and especially
of his own brother-in-law Mantegna, than by the more graceful
and facile style of Jacopo. This influence seems to have lasted
at full strength until after the departure of his brother-in-law
Mantegna for the court of Mantua in 1460. The earliest of
Giovanni&rsquo;s independent works no doubt date from before this
period. Three of these exist at the Correr museum in Venice:
a Crucifixion, a Transfiguration, and a Dead Christ supported by
Angels. Two Madonnas of the same or even earlier date are in
private collections in America, a third in that of Signor Frizzoni
at Milan; while two beautiful works in the National Gallery
of London seem to bring the period to a close. One of these is
of a rare subject, the Blood of the Redeemer; the other is the
fine picture of Christ&rsquo;s Agony in the Garden, formerly in the
Northbrook collection. The last-named piece was evidently
executed in friendly rivalry with Mantegna, whose version of
the subject hangs near by; the main idea of the composition
in both cases being taken from a drawing by Jacopo Bellini in
the British Museum sketch-book. In all these pictures Giovanni
combines with the Paduan severity of drawing and complex
rigidity of drapery a depth of religious feeling and human pathos
which is his own. They are all executed in the old tempera
method; and in the last named the tragedy of the scene is
softened by a new and beautiful effect of romantic sunrise
colour. In a somewhat changed and more personal manner,
with less harshness of contour and a broader treatment of forms
and draperies, but not less force of religious feeling, are the two
pictures of the Dead Christ supported by Angels, in these days
one of the master&rsquo;s most frequent themes, at Rimini and at
Berlin. Chronologically to be placed with these are two
Madonnas, one at the church of the Madonna del Orto at Venice
and one in the Lochis collection at Bergamo; devout intensity
of feeling and rich solemnity of colour being in the case of all
these early Madonnas combined with a singularly direct rendering
of the natural movements and attitudes of children.</p>

<p>The above-named works, all still executed in tempera, are
no doubt earlier than the date of Giovanni&rsquo;s first appointment
to work along with his brother and other artists in the Scuola
di San Marco, where among other subjects he was commissioned
in 1470 to paint a Deluge with Noah&rsquo;s Ark. None of the master&rsquo;s
works of this kind, whether painted for the various schools or
confraternities or for the ducal palace, have survived. To the
decade following 1470 must probably be assigned a Transfiguration
now in the Naples museum, repeating with greatly ripened
powers and in a much serener spirit the subject of his early
effort at Venice; and also the great altar-piece of the Coronation
of the Virgin at Pesaro, which would seem to be his earliest
effort in a form of art previously almost monopolized in Venice
by the rival school of the Vivarini. Probably not much later
was the still more famous altar-piece painted in tempera for a
chapel in the church of S. Giovanni e Paolo, where it perished
along with Titian&rsquo;s Peter Martyr and Tintoretto&rsquo;s Crucifixion
in the disastrous fire of 1867. After 1479-1480 very much of
Giovanni&rsquo;s time and energy must have been taken up by his
duties as conservator of the paintings in the great hall of the ducal
palace, in payment for which he was awarded, first the reversion
of a broker&rsquo;s place in the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, and afterwards,
as a substitute, a fixed annual pension of eighty ducats. Besides
repairing and renewing the works of his predecessors he was
commissioned to paint a number of new subjects, six or seven
in all, in further illustration of the part played by Venice in the
wars of Barbarossa and the pope. These works, executed with
much interruption and delay, were the object of universal admiration
while they lasted, but not a trace of them survived the fire
of 1577; neither have any other examples of his historical and
processional compositions come down, enabling us to compare
his manner in such subjects with that of his brother Gentile.
Of the other, the religious class of his work, including both
altar-pieces with many figures and simple Madonnas, a considerable
number have fortunately been preserved. They show him
gradually throwing off the last restraints of the 15th-century
manner; gradually acquiring a complete mastery of the new oil
medium introduced in Venice by Antonello da Messina about
1473, and mastering with its help all, or nearly all, the secrets
of the perfect fusion of colours and atmospheric gradation of
tones. The old intensity of pathetic and devout feeling gradually
fades away and gives place to a noble, if more worldly, serenity
and charm. The enthroned Virgin and Child become tranquil and
commanding in their sweetness; the personages of the attendant
saints gain in power, presence and individuality; enchanting
groups of singing and viol-playing angels symbolize and complete
the harmony of the scene. The full splendour of Venetian colour
invests alike the figures, their architectural framework, the
landscape and the sky. The altar-piece of the Frari at Venice,
the altar-piece of San Giobbe, now at the academy, the Virgin
between SS. Paul and George, also at the academy, and the altar-piece
with the kneeling doge Barbarigo at Murano, are among
the most conspicuous examples. Simple Madonnas of the same
period (about 1485-1490) are in the Venice academy, in the
National Gallery, at Turin and at Bergamo. An interval of some
years, no doubt chiefly occupied with work in the Hall of the Great
Council, seems to separate the last-named altar-pieces from that
of the church of San Zaccaria at Venice, which is perhaps the
most beautiful and imposing of all, and is dated 1505, the year
following that of Giorgione&rsquo;s Madonna at Castelfranco. Another
great altar-piece with saints, that of the church of San Francesco
de la Vigna at Venice, belongs to 1507; that of La Corona at
Vicenza, a Baptism of Christ in a landscape, to 1510; to 1513
that of San Giovanni Crisostomo at Venice, where the aged saint
Jerome, seated on a hill, is raised high against a resplendent
sunset background, with SS. Christopher and Augustine standing
facing each other below him, in front. Of Giovanni&rsquo;s activity
in the interval between the altar-pieces of San Giobbe and of
Murano and that of San Zaccaria, there are a few minor evidences
left, though the great mass of its results perished with the fire
of the ducal palace in 1577. The examples that remain consist
of one very interesting and beautiful allegorical picture in the
Uffizi at Florence, the subject of which had remained a riddle
until it was recently identified as an illustration of a French
medieval allegory, the <i>Pèlerinage de l&rsquo;âme</i> by Guillaume de
Guilleville; with a set of five other allegories or moral emblems,
on a smaller scale and very romantically treated, in the academy
at Venice. To these should probably be added, as painted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page703" id="page703"></a>703</span>
towards the year 1505, the portrait of the doge Loredano in the
National Gallery, the only portrait by the master which has
been preserved, and in its own manner one of the most masterly
in the whole range of painting.</p>

<p>The last ten or twelve years of the master&rsquo;s life saw him
besieged with more commissions than he could well complete.
Already in the years 1501-1504 the marchioness Isabella Gonzaga
of Mantua had had great difficulty in obtaining delivery from
him of a picture of the &ldquo;Madonna and Saints&rdquo; (now lost) for
which part payment had been made in advance. In 1505 she
endeavoured through Cardinal Bembo to obtain from him another
picture, this time of a secular or mythological character. What
the subject of this piece was, or whether it was actually delivered,
we do not know. Albrecht Dürer, visiting Venice for a second
time in 1506, reports of Giovanni Bellini as still the best painter
in the city, and as full of all courtesy and generosity towards
foreign brethren of the brush. In 1507 Gentile Bellini died,
and Giovanni completed the picture of the &ldquo;Preaching of St
Mark&rdquo; which he had left unfinished; a task on the fulfilment of
which the bequest by the elder brother to the younger of their
father&rsquo;s sketch-book had been made conditional. In 1513
Giovanni&rsquo;s position as sole master (since the death of his brother
and of Alvise Vivarini) in charge of the paintings in the Hall
of the Great Council was threatened by an application on the
part of his own former pupil, Titian, for a joint-share in the
same undertaking, to be paid for on the same terms. Titian&rsquo;s
application was first granted, then after a year rescinded, and
then after another year or two granted again; and the aged
master must no doubt have undergone some annoyance from
his sometime pupil&rsquo;s proceedings. In 1514 Giovanni undertook
to paint a Bacchanal for the duke Alfonso of Ferrara, but died
in 1516; leaving it to be finished by his pupils; this picture is
now at Alnwick.</p>

<p>Both in the artistic and in the worldly sense, the career of
Giovanni Bellini was upon the whole the most serenely and
unbrokenly prosperous, from youth to extreme old age, which
fell to the lot of any artist of the early Renaissance. He lived
to see his own school far outshine that of his rivals, the Vivarini
of Murano; he embodied, with ever growing and maturing
power, all the devotional gravity and much also of the worldly
splendour of the Venice of his time; and he saw his influence
propagated by a host of pupils, two of whom at least, Giorgione
and Titian, surpassed their master. Giorgione he outlived by
five years; Titian, as we have seen, challenged an equal place
beside his teacher. Among the best known of his other pupils
were, in his earlier time, Andrea Previtali, Cima da Conegliano,
Marco Basaiti, Niccolo Rondinelli, Piermaria Pennacchi, Martino
da Udine, Girolamo Mocetto; in later time, Pierfrancesco
Bissolo, Vincenzo Catena, Lorenzo Lotto and Sebastian del
Piombo.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELLINI, LORENZO<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> (1643-1704), Italian physician and
anatomist, was born at Florence on the 3rd of September 1643.
At the age of twenty, when he had already begun his researches
on the structure of the kidneys and had described the ducts
known by his name (<i>Exercitatio anatomica de structura et usu
renum</i>, 1662), he was chosen professor of theoretical medicine
at Pisa, but soon after was transferred to the chair of anatomy.
After spending thirty years at Pisa, he was invited to Florence
and appointed physician to the grand duke Cosimo III., and was
also made senior consulting physician to Pope Clement XI.
He died at Florence on the 8th of January 1704. His works
were published in a collected form at Venice in 1708.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BELLINI, VINCENZO<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> (1801-1835), operatic composer of the
Italian school, was born at Catania in Sicily, on the 1st of
November 1801. He was descended from a family of musicians,
both his father and grandfather having been composers of some
reputation. After having received his preparatory musical
education at home, he entered the conservatoire of Naples,
where he studied singing and composition under Tritto and
Zingarelli. He soon began to write pieces for various instruments,
as well as a cantata and several masses and other sacred compositions.
His first opera, <i>Adelson e Savina</i>, was performed in
1825 at a small theatre in Naples; his second dramatic work,
<i>Bianca e Fernando</i>, was produced next year at the San Carlo
theatre of the same city, and made his name known in Italy.
His next work, <i>Il Pirata</i> (1827), was written for the Scala in
Milan, to words by Felice Romano, with whom Bellini formed
a union of friendship to be severed only by his death. The
splendid rendering of the music by Tamburini, Rubini and other
great Italian singers contributed greatly to the success of the
work, which at once established the European reputation of its
composer. In almost every year of the short remainder of his
life he produced a new operatic work, which was received with
rapture by the audiences of France, Italy, Germany and England.
The names and dates of four of Bellini&rsquo;s operas familiar to most
lovers of Italian music are: <i>I Montecchi e Capuleti</i> (1830), in
which the part of Romeo became a favourite with all the great
contraltos; <i>La Sonnambula</i> (1831); <i>Norma</i>, Bellini&rsquo;s best and
most popular creation (1831); and <i>I Puritani</i> (1835), written for
the Italian opera in Paris, and to some extent under the influence
of French music. In 1833 Bellini had left his country to accompany
to England the singer Pasta, who had created the part of
his <i>Sonnambula</i>. In 1834 he accepted an invitation to write an
opera for the national grand opera in Paris. While he was
carefully studying the French language and the cadence of French
verse for the purpose, he was seized with a sudden illness and
died at his villa in Puteaux near Paris on the 24th of September
1835. His operatic creations are throughout replete with a
spirit of gentle melancholy, frequently monotonous and almost
always undramatic, but at the same time irresistibly sweet.
To this spirit, combined with a rich flow of <i>cantilena</i>, Bellini&rsquo;s
operas owe their popularity. &ldquo;I shall never forget,&rdquo; wrote
Wagner, &ldquo;the impression made upon me by an opera of Bellini
at a period when I was completely exhausted with the everlastingly
abstract complication used in our orchestras, when a
simple and noble melody was revealed anew to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELLINZONA<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> (Ger. <i>Belienz</i>), the political capital of the
Swiss canton of Tessin or Ticino. It is 105 m. from Lucerne by
the St Gotthard railway, 19 m. from Lugano and 14 m. from
Locarno at the head of the Lago Maggiore, these two towns
having been till 1881 capitals of the canton jointly with Bellinzona.
The old town is built on some hills, on the left bank of the
Tessin or Ticino river, and a little below the junction of the main
Ticino valley (the Val Leventina) with that of Mesocco. It
thus blocked the road from Germany to Italy, while a great wall
was built from the town to the river bank. Bellinzona still
possesses three picturesque castles (restored in modern times),
dating in their present form from the 15th century. They
belonged for several centuries to the three Swiss cantons which
were masters of the town. The most westerly, Castello Grande
or of San Michele, belonged to Uri; the central castle, that of
Montebello, was the property of Schwyz; while the most
easterly castle, that of Sasso Corbaro, was in the hands of
Unterwalden. The 13th-century church of San Biagio (Blaise) has a
remarkable 14th-century fresco, while the collegiate church of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page704" id="page704"></a>704</span>
San Stefano dates from the 16th century. In 1900 the population
of Bellinzona was 4949, practically all Romanists and Italian-speaking.</p>

<p>Possibly Bellinzona is of Roman origin, but it is first mentioned
in 590. It played a considerable part in the early history of
Lombardy, being a key to several Alpine passes. In the 8th
century it belonged to the bishop of Como, while in the 13th and
14th centuries it was tossed to and fro between the cities of Milan
and Como. In 1402 it was taken from Milan by Albert von Sax,
lord of the Val Mesocco, who in 1419 sold it to Uri and Obwalden,
which, however, lost it to Milan in 1422 after the battle of Arbedo.
In 1499 (like the rest of the Milanese) it was occupied by the
French, but in 1500 it was taken by Uri. In 1503 the French king
ceded it to Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, which henceforth
ruled it very harshly through their bailiffs till 1798. At that
date it became the capital of the canton Bellinzona of the
Helvetic republic, but in 1803 it was united to the newly-formed
canton of Tessin.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELLMAN, KARL MIKAEL<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> (1740-1795), Swedish poet, son
of a civil servant, was born at Stockholm on the 4th of February
1740. When quite a child he developed an extraordinary gift
of improvising verse, during the delirium of a severe illness,
weaving wild thoughts together lyrically and singing airs of his
own composition. When he was nineteen he became clerk in
a bank and afterwards in the customs, but his habits were
irregular and he was frequently in great distress, particularly
after the death of his patron, <span class="sc">Gustavus</span> III. As early as 1757
he published <i>Evangeliska Dödstankar</i>, meditations on the
Passion from the German of David von Schweidnitz, and during
the next few years wrote, besides other translations, a great
quantity of poems, imitative for the most part of Dalin. In
1760 appeared his first characteristic work, <i>Månan</i> (The Moon),
a satirical poem, which was revised and edited by Dalin. But
the great work of his life occupied him from 1765 to 1780, and
consists of the collections of dithyrambic odes known as <i>Fredmans
Epistlar</i> (1790) and <i>Fredmans Sånger</i> (1791). Fredman
and his friends were well-known characters in the Stockholm
pot-houses, where Bellman had studied them from the life.
No poetry can possibly smell less of the lamp than Bellman&rsquo;s.
He was accustomed, when in the presence of none but confidential
friends, to announce that the god was about to visit
him. He would shut his eyes, take his zither, and begin apparently
to improvise the music and the words of a long Bacchic
ode in praise of love or wine. Most of his melodies are taken
direct, or with slight adaptations, from old Swedish ballads, and
still retain their popularity. <i>Fredman&rsquo;s Epistles</i> bear the clear
impress of individual genius; his torrents of rhymes are not
without their method; wild as they seem, they all conform to
the rules of style, and among those that have been preserved
there are few that are not perfect in form. A great Swedish
critic has remarked that the voluptuous joviality and the humour
of Bellman is, after all, only &ldquo;sorrow clad in rose-colour,&rdquo; and
this underlying pathos gives his poems their undying charm.
His later works, <i>Bacchi Tempel</i> (The Temple of Bacchus) (1783),
eight numbers of a journal called <i>Hvad behagas?</i> (What you
Will) (1781), in 1780 a religious anthology entitled in a later
edition (1787) <i>Zions Hogtid</i> (Zion&rsquo;s Holiday), and a translation
of Gellert&rsquo;s <i>Fables</i>, are comparatively unimportant. He died
on the 11th of February 1795. Much of Bellman&rsquo;s work was
only printed after his death, <i>Bihang till Fredmans Epistlar</i>
(Nyköping, 1809), <i>Fredmans Handskrifter</i> (Upsala, 1813),
<i>Skaldestycken</i> (&ldquo;Poems,&rdquo; Stockholm, 1814) being among the
most important of these posthumous works. A colossal bronze
bust of the poet by Byström (erected by the Swedish Academy
in 1829) adorns the public gardens of Stockholm, and a statue
by Alfred Nyström is in the Hasselbacken, Stockholm. Bellman
had a grand manner, a fine voice and great gifts of mimicry,
and was a favourite companion of King Gustavus III.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The best edition of his works was published at Stockholm, edited
by J.G. Carlén, with biographical notes, illustrations and music
(5 vols., 1856-1861); see also monographs on Bellman by Nils
Erdmann (Stockholm, 1895) and by F. Niedner (Berlin, 1905).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELLO, ANDRÉS <a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span>(1781-1865), South American poet and
scholar, was born at Caracas (Venezuela) on the 29th of November
1781, and in early youth held a minor post in the civil administration.
He joined the colonial revolutionary party, and in 1810
was sent on a political mission to London, where he resided for
nineteen years, acting as secretary to the legations of Chile,
Colombia and Venezuela, studying in the British Museum,
supplementing his small salary by giving private lessons in
Spanish, by journalistic work and by copying Jeremy Bentham&rsquo;s
almost indecipherable manuscripts. In 1829 he accepted a
post in the Chilean treasury, settled at Santiago and took a
prominent part in founding the national university (1843), of
which he became rector. He was nominated senator, and died
at Santiago de Chile on the 15th of October 1865. Bello was
mainly responsible for the civil code promulgated on the 14th
of December 1855. His prose works deal with such various
subjects as law, philosophy, literary criticism and philology;
of these the most important is his <i>Gramática castellana</i> (1847),
the leading authority on the subject. But his position in literature
proper is secured by his <i>Silvas Americanas</i>, a poem written
during his residence in England, which conveys with extraordinary
force the majestic impression of the South American landscape.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELLONA<a name="ar135" id="ar135"></a></span> (originally <span class="sc">Duellona</span>), in Roman mythology,
the goddess of war (<i>bellum</i>, <i>i.e.</i> <i>duellum</i>), corresponding to the
Greek Enyo. By later mythologists she is called sometimes
the sister, daughter or wife of Mars, sometimes his charioteer
or nurse. Her worship appears to have been promoted in Rome
chiefly by the family of the Claudii, whose Sabine origin, together
with their use of the name of &ldquo;Nero,&rdquo; has suggested an identification
of Bellona with the Sabine war goddess Nerio, herself
identified, like Bellona, with Virtus. Her temple at Rome,
dedicated by Appius Claudius Caecus (296 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) during a battle
with the Samnites and Etruscans (Ovid, <i>Fasti</i> vi. 201), stood in
the Campus Martius, near the Flaminian Circus, and outside
the gates of the city. It was there that the senate met to discuss
a general&rsquo;s claim to a triumph, and to receive ambassadors
from foreign states. In front of it was the <i>columna bellica</i>,
where the ceremony of declaring war by the fetialis was performed.
From this native Italian goddess is to be distinguished the
Asiatic Bellona, whose worship was introduced into Rome from
Comana, in Cappadocia, apparently by Sulla, to whom she had
appeared, urging him to march to Rome and bathe in the blood
of his enemies (Plutarch, <i>Sulla</i>, 9). For her a new temple was
built, and a college of priests (<i>Bellonarii</i>) instituted to conduct
her fanatical rites, the prominent feature of which was to lacerate
themselves and sprinkle the blood on the spectators (Tibullus
i. 6. 45-50). To make the scene more grim they wore black
dresses (Tertullian, <i>De Pallio</i>) from head to foot. The festival
of Bellona, which originally took place on the 3rd of June, was
altered to the 24th of March, after the confusion of the Roman
Bellona with her Asiatic namesake.</p>

farrier. With the aid of the authorities of his native town he

and received the cross of the Legion of Honour for
distinguished conduct. He afterwards took part in another
Anglo-French expedition, that of Parana, which opened the
river La Plata to commerce. In 1851 he joined the Arctic
expedition under the command of Captain Kennedy in search
of Sir John Franklin, and discovered the strait between Boothia
Felix and Somerset Land which bears his name. Early in 1852
he was promoted lieutenant, and in the same year accompanied
the Franklin search expedition under Captain Inglefield. As on
the previous occasion, his intelligence, devotion to duty and
courage won him the esteem and admiration of all with whom he
was associated. While making a perilous journey with two
comrades for the purpose of communicating with Sir Edward
Belcher, he suddenly disappeared in an opening between the
broken masses of ice (August 1853). A pension was granted to
his family by the emperor Napoleon III., and an obelisk was

(1837-1838) at Mobile, Alabama, and in 1839 became pastor of
the First Congregational (Unitarian) church in New York City

in the Unitarian Church in America. For many years after 1846
he edited <i>The Christian Inquirer</i>, a Unitarian weekly paper, and
he was also for some time an editor of <i>The Christian Examiner</i>.
In 1857 he delivered a series of lectures in the Lowell Institute
course, on &ldquo;The Treatment of Social Diseases.&rdquo; At the outbreak

<p><span class="bold">BELLOWS<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> and <b>BLOWING MACHINES,</b> appliances used for
producing currents of air, or for moving volumes of air from one
place to another. Formerly all such artificially-produced
currents of air were used to assist the combustion of fires and
furnaces, but now this purpose only forms a part of the uses to
which they are put. Blowing appliances, among which are
included bellows, rotary fans, blowing engines, rotary blowers
and steam-jet blowers, are now also employed for forcing pure
air into buildings and mines for purposes of ventilation, for
withdrawing vitiated air for the same reason, and for supplying
the air or other gas which is required in some chemical processes.
Appliances of this kind differ from <i>air compressors</i> in that they
are primarily intended for the transfer of quantities of air at low
pressures, very little above that of the atmosphere, whereas the
latter are used for supplying air which has previously been
raised to a pressure which may be many times that of the atmosphere
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Power Transmission</a></span>: <i>Pneumatic</i>).</p>

<p>Among the earliest contrivances employed for producing the
movement of air under a small pressure were those used in Egypt
during the Greek occupation. These depended upon the heating
of the air, which, being raised in pressure and bulk, was made to
force water out of closed vessels, the water being afterwards
employed for moving some kind of mechanism. In the process
of iron smelting there is still used in some parts of India an
artificial blast, produced by a simple form of bellows made from
the skins of goats; bellows of this kind probably represent one
of the earliest contrivances used for producing currents of air.</p>

<p>The <i>bellows</i><a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> now in use consists, in its simplest form, of two
flat boards, of rectangular, circular or pear shape, connected
round their edges by a wide band of leather so as to include an
air chamber, which can be increased or diminished in volume by
separating the boards or bringing them nearer together. The
leather is kept from collapsing, on the separation of the boards,
by several rings of wire which act like the ribs of animals. The
lower board has a hole in the centre, covered inside by a leather
flap or valve which can only open inwards; there is also an open
outlet, generally in the form of a pipe or nozzle, whose aperture
is much smaller than that of the valve. When the upper board
is raised air rushes into the cavity through the valve to fill up
the partial vacuum produced; on again depressing the upper
board the valve is closed by the air attempting to rush out again,
and this air is discharged through the open nozzle with a velocity
depending on the pressure exerted.</p>

<p>The current of air produced is evidently not continuous but
intermittent or in puffs, because an interval is needed to refill
the cavity after each discharge. In order to remedy this drawback
the <i>double bellows</i> are used. To understand their action
it is only necessary to conceive an additional board with valve,
like the lower board of the single bellows, attached in the same
way by leather below this lower board. Thus there are three
boards, forming two cavities, the two lower boards being fitted
with air-valves. The lowest board is held down by a weight and
another weight rests on the top board. In working these double
bellows the lowest board is raised, and drives the air from the
lower cavity into the upper. On lowering the bottom board
again a fresh supply of air is drawn in through the bottom valve,
to be again discharged when the board is raised. As the air
passes from the lower to the upper cavity it is prevented from
returning by the valve in the middle board, and in this way a
quantity of air is sent into the upper cavity each time the lowest
board is raised. The weight on the top board provides the
necessary pressure for the blast, and at the same time causes
the current of air delivered to be fairly continuous. When the
air is being forced into the upper cavity the weight is being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page706" id="page706"></a>706</span>
raised, and, during the interval when the lowest board is descending,
the weight is slowly forcing the top board down and thus
keeping up the flow of air.</p>

<p>Hand-bellows for domestic use are generally shaped like a
pear, with the hinge at the narrow end. The same shape was
adopted for the older forms of smiths&rsquo; bellows, with the difference
that two bellows were used superposed, in a manner similar to
that just described, so as to provide for a continuous blast. In
the later form of smiths&rsquo; bellows the same principle is employed,
but the boards are made circular in shape and are always maintained
roughly parallel to one another. These are shown on figs.
1 and 2. Here A is the blast pipe, B the movable lowest board,
C the fixed
middle board,
close to which
the pipe A is
inserted, and D
is the movable
uppermost board
pressed upon by
the weight
shown. The
board B is raised
by means of a
hand lever L,
through either a
chain or a connecting
rod, and
lowered by a
weight. The size
of the weight on D depends on the air pressure required.
For instance, if a blast pressure of half a pound per
square inch is wanted and the boards are 18 in. in diameter,
and therefore have an area of 254 sq. in., on each of the
254 sq. in. there is to be a pressure of half a pound, so that
the weight to balance this must be half multiplied by 254, or
127 &#8468; The diameter of the air-pipe can be varied to
suit the required conditions. Instead of bellows with flexible
sides, a sliding arrangement is sometimes used; this consists
of what are really two boxes fitting into one another with the
open sides both facing inwards, as if one were acting as a lid
to the other. By having a valve and outlet pipe fitted as in
the bellows and sliding them alternately apart and together, an
intermittent blast is produced. The chief defect of this arrangement
is the leakage of air caused by the difficulty in making the
joint a sufficiently good fit to be air-tight.</p>

<p><i>Blowing Engines.</i>&mdash;Where larger quantities of air at higher
pressures than can conveniently be supplied by bellows are required,
as for blast furnaces and the Bessemer process of steel-making,
what are termed &ldquo;blowing engines&rdquo; are used. The
mode of action of a blowing engine is simple. When a piston,
accurately fitting a cylinder which has one end closed, is forcibly
moved towards the other end, a partial vacuum is formed
between the piston and the blank end, and if this space be
allowed to communicate with the outer atmosphere air will
flow in to fill the vacuum. When the piston has completed its
movement or &ldquo;stroke,&rdquo; the cylinder will have been filled with
air. On the return of the piston, if the valve through which
the air entered is now closed and a second one communicating
with a chamber or pipe is opened, the air in the cylinder is
expelled through this second valve. The action is similar to
that of the bellows, but is carried out in a machine which is much
better able to resist higher pressures and which is more convenient
for dealing with large quantities of air. The valves through
which the atmosphere or &ldquo;free&rdquo; air is admitted are called
&ldquo;admission&rdquo; or &ldquo;suction&rdquo; valves, and those through which
the air is driven from the cylinder are the &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; or
&ldquo;delivery&rdquo; valves. Formerly one side only of the blowing
piston was used, the engine working &ldquo;single-acting&rdquo;; but now
both sides of the piston are utilized, so that when it is moving
in either direction suction will be taking place on one side and
delivery on the other. All processes in connexion with which
blowing engines are used require the air to be above the pressure
of the outer atmosphere. This means that the discharge valves
do not open quite at the beginning of the delivery stroke, but
remain closed until the air in the cylinder has been reduced
in volume and so increased in pressure to that of the air in the
discharge chamber.</p>

<p>The power used to actuate these blowing-engines is in most
cases steam, the steam cylinder being placed in line or &ldquo;tandem&rdquo;
with the air cylinder, so that the steam piston rod is continuous
with or directly joined to the piston rod of the air cylinder.
This plan is always adopted where the cylinders are placed
horizontally, and often in the case of vertical engines. The
engines are generally built in pairs, with two blowing cylinders
and one high-pressure and one low-pressure steam cylinder, the
piston rods terminating in connecting rods which are attached
to the pins of the two cranks on the shaft. In the centre of this
shaft, midway between the two engines, there is usually placed
a heavy flywheel which helps to maintain a uniform speed of
turning. Some of the largest blowing engines built in Great
Britain are arranged as beam engines; that is to say, there is
a heavy rocking beam of cast iron which in its middle position
is horizontal. One end of this beam is linked by a short connecting
rod to the end of the piston rod of the blowing cylinder,
while the other end is similarly linked to the top of the steam
piston rod, so that as the steam piston comes up the air piston
goes down and <i>vice versa</i>. At the steam end of the beam a third
connecting rod works the crank of a flywheel shaft.</p>

<p>About the end of the 19th century an important development
took place which consisted in using the waste gas from blast
furnaces to form with air an explosive mixture, and employing
this mixture to drive the piston of the actuating cylinder in
precisely the same manner as the explosive mixture of coal gas
and air is used in a gas engine. Since the majority of blowing
engines are used for providing the air required in iron blast
furnaces, considerable saving should be effected in this way,
because the gas which escapes from the top of the furnace is
a waste product and costs nothing to produce.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Section of Cylinder of Early Blowing Engine (1851).</td></tr></table>

<p>The general action of a blowing engine may be illustrated
by the sectional view shown on fig. 3, which represents the
internal view of one of the blowing cylinders of the engines
erected at the Dowlais Ironworks as far back as 1851. Many of
the details are now obsolete, but the general scheme is the same
as in all blowing engines. Here A is the air cylinder; in this is a
piston whose rod is marked R; this piston is usually made
air-tight by some form of packing fitted into the groove which
runs round its edge. In this particular case the cylinder is placed
vertically and its piston rod is actuated from the end of a rocking
beam. The top and bottom ends are closed by covers and in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page707" id="page707"></a>707</span>
are a number of openings controlled by valves opening inwards
so that air can flow freely in but cannot return. The piston is
shown moving downwards. Air is now being drawn into the
space above the piston through the valves v at the top, and the
air in the space A below the piston, drawn in during the previous
up-stroke, is being expelled through the valve v&prime; into the discharge
chamber B, thence passing to the outlet pipe O. The action
is reversed on the up-stroke. Thus it will be seen that air is being
delivered both during the up-stroke and the down-stroke, and
therefore flows almost continuously to the furnaces. There must,
however, be momentary pauses at the ends of the strokes when
the direction of movement is changed, and as the piston, though
worked from an evenly rotating crank shaft, moves more quickly
at the middle and slows down to no speed at the ends of its
travel, there must be a considerable variation in the speed of
delivery of the air. The air is therefore led from O into a large
storage chamber or reservoir, whence it is again taken to the
furnace; if this reservoir is made sufficiently large the elasticity
of the air in it will serve to compensate for the irregularities, and
a nearly uniform stream of air will flow from it. The valves
used in this case and in most of the older blowing engines consist
of rectangular metal plates hinged at one of the longer edges;
these plates are faced with leather or india rubber so as to allow
them to come to rest quietly and without clatter and at the same
time to make them air-tight. It will be seen that some of these
valves hang vertically and others lie flat on the bottom of the
cover. The Dowlais cylinder is very large, having a diameter
of 12 ft. and a piston stroke of 12 ft., giving a discharge of 44,000
cub. ft. of air per minute, at a pressure of 4¼ &#8468; to the square inch.</p>

<p>A later design of blowing engine, built in 1871 for the Lackenby
iron-works, Middlesbrough, is shown in section in fig. 4, and
is of a type which is still the most common, especially in the
north of England. Here A, the high-pressure steam cylinder,
and C, the low-pressure one, are placed in tandem with the air
cylinders B, B, whose pistons they actuate. In these blowing
cylinders the inlet valves in the bottom are circular disk valves
of leather, eighteen in number; the inlet valves T on the top of
the cylinder are arranged in ten rectangular boxes, having
openings in their vertical sides, inside which are hung leather
flap valves. The outlet valves O are ten in number at each end
of the cylinders, and are hung against flat gratings which are
arranged round the circumference. The blast is delivered into
a wrought iron casing M which surrounds the cylinder. The
combined area of the inlet valves is 860 sq. in., or one-sixth the
area of the piston. The speed is twenty-four revolutions per
minute and the air delivered at this speed is 15,072 cubic ft. per
minute, the horse-power in the air cylinders being 258. The
circulating pump E, air pump F, and feed pumps G, G, are
worked off the cross-head on the low-pressure side.</p>

<p>A more modern form of blowing engine erected at the Dowlais
works about the end of the 19th century, may be taken as
typical of the present design of vertical blowing engine in use
in Great Britain. The two air cylinders are placed below and in
tandem with the steam cylinders as in the last case. The piston
rods also terminate in connecting rods working on to the crank
shaft. The air cylinders are each 88 in. in diameter, and the
high and low pressure cylinders of the compound steam engine
are 30 in. and 64 in. respectively, while the common stroke of all
four is 60 in. The pressure of the air delivered varies from 4½
to 10 &#8468; per sq. in. and the quantity per minute is 25,000 cub. ft.
Each engine develops about 1200 horse-power. It is to be
noted that flap valves such as those used in the 1851 Dowlais
engine have in most cases given place to a larger number of
circular steel disk valves, held to their seats by springs.</p>

<p>In a large blowing engine built in 1905 by Messrs Davy Bros.
of Sheffield for the North-Eastern Steel Company at Middlesbrough
(see <i>Engineering</i>, January 6, 1905) the same arrangement
was adopted as in that just described. The two air cylinders are
each 90 in. diameter and have a stroke of 72 in. The capacity of
this engine is 52,000 cub. ft. of air per minute, delivered at a
pressure of from 12½ to 15 &#8468; per sq. in. when running at a speed
of thirty-three revolutions per minute. The air valves consist
of a large number of steel disks resting on circular seatings and
held down by springs, which for the delivery valves are so
adjusted in strength that they lift and release the air when the
desired working pressure has been reached. It is worthy of note
that in this engine no attempt is made to make the air pistons
air-tight in the usual way by having packing rings set in grooves
round the edge, but the piston is made deeper than usual and
turned so as to be a very good
fit in the cylinder and one or
two small grooves are cut
round the edge to hold the
lubricant.</p>

<p>To illustrate a blowing
engine driven by a gas engine
supplied with blast furnace
gas, fig. 5 gives a diagrammatic
view of the blowing
cylinder of an engine built
by Messrs Richardsons,
Westgarth &amp; Co. of
Middlesbrough about 1905.
The gas cylinder is not
shown. It will be seen
that the air cylinder is
horizontal, and it is arranged
to work in tandem with the gas motor cylinder. The chief
point of interest is to be found in the arrangement of the
details of the air cylinder. Its diameter is 86½ in. and the
length of piston stroke 55 in. As to the arrangement of the
valves, if the piston be moving in the direction shown, on
the left side of the piston at A air is being discharged, and
follows the course indicated by the arrows, so as first to pass
into the annular chamber which forms a continuation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page708" id="page708"></a>708</span>
space A, and thence, through the spring-controlled steel disk
valves v&prime;, into the discharge chamber C, which ultimately leads
to the blast pipe. It will be seen that the valves v on the other
side of the annular chamber are closed. At the same time a
partial vacuum is being formed in the space B, to be filled by
the inflow of air through the valves v which are now open, the
corresponding discharge valves v&prime; being closed. These valves
on the inside and outside of the annular spaces referred to are
arranged so as to form a circle round the ends of the barrel of the
cylinder. The free air, instead of being drawn into the valves v
direct from the air of the engine house, is taken from an enclosed
annular chamber E, which may be in communication with the
clean, cool air outside. It will be seen that the piston is made
deep so as to allow for a long bearing surface in the cylinder.
Two metal packing rings are provided to render the piston
air-tight. The horse-power of this engine, which is designed
on the Cockerell system, is 750.</p>

<p>Air valves of other types than those which have been mentioned
have been tried, such as sliding grid valves, rotatory slide valves
and piston valves, but it has been found that either flap or disk
lift valves are more satisfactory for air on account of the grit
which is liable to get between slide valves and their seatings.
In some of the blowing engines made by Messrs Fraser &amp;
Chalmers (see <i>Engineer</i>, June 15, 1906), sheets of flexible bronze
act as flap valves both for admission and delivery, the part
which actually closes the opening being thickened for strength.</p>

<p>The pressure of the air supplied by blowing engines depends
upon the purposes for which it is to be used. In charcoal
furnaces the pressure is very low, being less than 1 &#8468; per sq. in.;
for blast furnaces using coal an average value of 4 &#8468; is common;
for American blast furnaces using coke or anthracite coal the
pressure is as high as 10 &#8468;; while for the air required in the
Bessemer process of steel-making pressures up to 25 or 30 &#8468;
per sq. in. are not uncommon. According to British practice
one large blowing engine is used to supply several blast furnaces,
while in America a number of smaller ones is used, one for each
furnace.</p>

<p><i>Rotary blowers</i> occupy a position midway between blowing
engines and fan blowers, being used for purposes requiring the
delivery of large volumes of air at pressures lower than those of
blowing engines, but higher than those of fan blowers. The
blowing engine draws in, compresses and delivers its air by the
direct action of air-tight pistons; the same effect is aimed at in a
rotary blower with
the difference that
the piston revolves
instead of moving up
and down a cylinder.</p>

<p>Two of the best-known
machines of
this kind are Roots&rsquo;
and Baker&rsquo;s, both
American devices.
The mode of action
of Roots&rsquo; blower,
as made by Messrs
Thwaites Bros. of
Bradford, will be
clear from the section
shown on fig. 6.
The moving parts
work in a closed
casing B, which consists
of half-cylindrical
curved plates
placed a little more
than their own radius apart, the ends being enclosed by two
plates. Within the casing, and barely touching the curved
part of the casing and each other, revolve two parts C, D,
called &ldquo;revolvers,&rdquo; the speed of rotation of which is the
same, but the direction opposite. They are compelled to keep
their proper relative positions by a pair of equal spur wheels
fixed on the ends of the shafts on which they run. The free air
enters the casing through a wire screen at A and passes into the
space E.</p>

<p>As the space E increases in volume owing to the movement
of the revolvers, air is drawn in; it is then imprisoned between
D and the casing, as shown at G, and is carried round until it is
free to enter F, from which it is in turn expelled by the lessening
of this space as the lower ends of the revolvers come together.
In this way a series of volumes of air is drawn in through A, to be
afterwards expelled from H in an almost perfectly continuous
stream, this result being brought about by the relative variation
in volume of the spaces E, F and G. In their most improved
form the revolvers are made hollow, of cast iron, and accurately
machined to a form such that they always keep close to one
another and to the end casing without actually touching, there
being never more space for the escape of air than <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">32</span>nd of an
inch. Machines after this design are made from the smallest size,
delivering 25 cub. ft., to the largest, with a capacity of 25,000
cub. ft. per minute working up to a pressure of 3 &#8468; per sq. in.
It is not found economical to attempt to work at higher pressures,
as the leakage between the revolvers and the casing becomes too
great; where a higher pressure is desired two or more blowers
can be worked in series, the air being raised in pressure by steps.
A blower using 1 H.P. will deliver 350 cub. ft. of air per minute
and one using 2¾ H.P. will deliver 800 cub. ft., at a pressure
suitable for smiths&rsquo; fires. At the higher pressure required for
cupola work&mdash;somewhere about ¾ &#8468; per sq. in.&mdash;6½ H.P. will
deliver 1300, and 123 H.P. 25,000 cub. ft. per minute. In the
Baker blower three revolvers are used&mdash;a large one which acts
as the rotating piston and two smaller ones forming air locks or
valves.</p>

<p><i>Rotary Fans</i>.&mdash;Now that power for driving them is so generally
available, rotary blowing fans have for many purposes taken
the place of bellows. They are used for blowing smiths&rsquo; fires, for
supplying the blast for iron melting cupolas and furnaces and the
forced draught for boiler fires, and for any other purpose requiring
a strong blast of air. Their construction will be clear from the
two views (figs. 7 and 8) of the form made by Messrs Günther of
Oldham, Lancashire. The fan consists of a circular casing A
having the general appearance of a snail shell. Within this
casing revolves a series of vanes B&mdash;in this case five&mdash;curved as
shown, and attached together so as to form a wheel whose centre
is a boss or hub. This boss is fixed to a shaft or spindle which
revolves in bearings supported on brackets outside the casing.
As the shaft is rotated, the vanes B are compelled to revolve in
the direction indicated by the arrow on fig. 7, and their rotation
causes the air within the casing to rotate also. Thus a centrifugal
action is set up by which there is a diminution of pressure
at the centre of the fan and an increase against the outer casing.
In consequence air is sucked in, as shown by the arrows on fig. 8,
through the openings C, C, at the centre of the casing around the
spindle. At the same time the air which has been forced towards
the outside of the casing and given a rotary motion is expelled
from the opening at D (fig. 8). All blowing fans work on the
same principle, though differences in detail are adopted by
different makers to meet the variety of conditions under which
they are to be used. Where the fan is to be employed for producing
a delivery or blast of air the opening D is connected to an
air pipe which serves to transmit the current of air, and C is left
open to the atmosphere; when, however, the main object is
suction, as in the case where the fan is used for ventilation, the
aperture C is connected through a suction pipe with the space to
be exhausted, D being usually left open. Günther fans range
in size from those which have a diameter of fan disk of 8 in. and
make 5500 revolutions per minute, to those which have a diameter
of 50 in. and run at from 950 to 1200 revolutions per
minute. For exhausting the fans are run less quickly than for
blowing, the speed for a fan of 10 in. diameter being 4800
revolutions for blowing and 3300-4000 for exhausting, while
the 50-in. fan only runs at 550-700 when exhausting. These two
exhausting fans remove 400-500 and 12,000-15,000 cub. ft. of
air per minute respectively.</p>

<p>The useful effect of rotary fans, that is to say the proportion
of the total power used to drive the fan which is actually utilized
in producing the current of air, is very low for the smaller sizes,
but may rise to 30-70% in sizes above 5 ft. in diameter. It has
its maximum value for any given fan at a certain definite speed.
Fans are most suitable in cases where it is required to move or
deliver comparatively large volumes of air at pressures which are
little above that of the atmosphere. Where the pressure of the
current produced exceeds a quarter of a pound on the square inch
the waste of work becomes so great as to preclude their use. The
fan is not the most economical form of blower, but it is simple
and inexpensive, both in first cost and in maintenance. The
largest fans are used for ventilating purposes, chiefly in mines,
their diameters rising to 40 or even 50 ft. The useful effect of
some of these larger fans, as obtained from experiments, is as
high as 75%. In the case of the Capell fan, which differs from
other forms in that it has two series of blades, inner and outer,
separated by a curved blank piece between the inner wings,
dipping into the fan inlet, and the outer wings, very high
efficiencies have been obtained, being as great as 90% in some cases.
Capell fans are used for ventilating mines, buildings, and ships,
and for providing induced currents for use in boiler furnaces.
In the larger fans the casing, instead of having a curved section,
is more often built of sheet steel and is given a rectangular
section at right angles to the periphery. The Sirocco blowing
fan, of Messrs Davidson of Belfast, has a larger number of blades,
which are relatively narrow as measured radially, but wide
axially. It can be made much smaller in diameter than fans of
the older designs for the same output of air&mdash;a great advantage
for use in ships or in buildings where space is limited&mdash;and its
useful effect is also said to be superior. (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hydraulics</a></span>,
§ 213.)</p>

<p><i>Helical or screw blowers</i>, often called &ldquo;air propellers,&rdquo; are used
where relatively large volumes of air have to be moved against
hardly any perceptible difference in pressure, chiefly for purposes
of ventilation and drying. Most often the propeller is used to
move air from one room or chamber to another adjoining, and
is placed in a light circular iron frame which is fixed in a hole in
the wall through which the air is to be passed. The propeller
itself consists of a series of vanes or wings arranged helically on a
revolving shaft which is fixed in the centre of the opening. The
centre line of the shaft is perpendicular to the plane of the opening
so that when the vanes revolve the air is drawn towards and
through the opening and is propelled away from it as it passes
through. The action is similar to that of a steamship screw
propeller, air taking the place of water. Such blowers are often
driven by small electric motors working directly on the end of
the shaft. For moving large volumes of air against little pressure
and suction they are very suitable, being simpler than fans,
cheaper both in first cost and maintenance for the same volume
of air delivered, and less likely to fail or get out of order. To
obtain the best effect for the power used a certain maximum
speed of rotation must not be exceeded; at higher speeds a great
deal of the power is wasted. For example, a propeller with a
vane diameter of 2½ ft. was found to deliver a volume of air
approximately proportional to the speed up to about 700 revolutions
per minute, when 8000 cub. ft. per minute were passed
through the machine; but doubling this speed to 1400 revolutions
per minute only increased delivery by 1000 cub. ft. to 9000.
At the lower of these speeds the horse-power absorbed was 0.6
and at the higher one 1.6.</p>

<p><i>Other Appliances for producing Currents of Air</i>.&mdash;In its primitive
form the &ldquo;trompe&rdquo; or water-blowing engine adopted in Savoy,
Carniola, and some parts of America, consists of a long vertical
wooden pipe terminating at its lower end in an air chest. Water
is allowed to enter the top of the pipe through a conical plug and,
falling down in streamlets, carries with it air which is drawn in
through sloping holes near the top of the pipe. In this way a
quantity of air is delivered into the chamber, its pressure depending
on the height through which the water falls. This simple
arrangement has been developed for use in compressing large
volumes of air at high pressures to be used for driving compressed
air machinery. It is chiefly used in America, and provides a
simple and cheap means of obtaining compressed air where there is
an abundant natural supply of water falling through a considerable
height. The pressure obtained in the air vessel is somewhat
less than half a pound per square inch for every foot of fall.</p>

<p>Natural sources of water are also used for compressing and
discharging air by letting the water under its natural pressure
enter and leave closed vessels, so alternately discharging and
drawing in new supplies of air. Here the action is the same as in
a blowing engine, the water taking the place of the piston.
This method was first thoroughly developed in connexion with
the Mt. Cenis tunnel works, and its use has since been extended.</p>

<p>In the <i>jet blower</i> (fig. 9) a jet of steam is used to induce a
current of air. Into one end of a trumpet-shaped pipe B projects
a steam pipe A. This steam pipe terminates in a small opening,
say, one-eighth of an inch, through which the steam is allowed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page710" id="page710"></a>710</span>
flow freely. The effect is to cause a movement of the air in the
pipe, with the result that a fresh supply is drawn in through the
annular opening at C, C, and a continuous stream of air passes
along the pipe. This is the form of blower made by Messrs
Meldrum Bros. of Manchester, and is largely used for delivering
air under the fire bars of boiler and other furnaces. In some
cases the jets of steam are allowed to enter a boiler furnace above
the fire, thus inducing a current of air which helps the chimney
draught and is often used to do away with the production of
smoke; they are also used for producing currents of air for
purposes other than those of boiler fires, and are very convenient
where considerable quantities of air are wanted at very low
pressures and where the presence of the moisture of the steam
does not matter.</p>

<p>Sometimes jets of high-pressure air flowing at great velocities
are used to induce more slowly-moving currents of larger volumes
of air at low pressures.</p>

&ldquo;blow-bag,&rdquo; cf. German <i>Blasebalg</i>. By the 11th century the first

Baelig</i> became in Middle English <i>bely</i>, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;belly,&rdquo; a sack or bag,

<p><span class="bold">BELLOY, DORMONT DE,<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> the name assumed by <span class="sc">Pierre
Laurext Buireite</span> (1727-1775), French dramatist, was born
at Saint-Flour, in Auvergne, on the 17th of November 1727.
He was educated by his uncle, a distinguished advocate in Paris,
for the bar. To escape from a profession he disliked he joined a
troupe of comedians playing in the courts of the northern
sovereigns. In 1758 the performance of his <i>Titus</i>, which had
already been produced in St Petersburg, was postponed through
his uncle&rsquo;s exertions; and when it did appear, a hostile cabal
procured its failure, and it was not until after his guardian&rsquo;s
death that de Belloy returned to Paris with <i>Zelmire</i> (1762),
a fantastic drama which met with great success. This was
followed in 1765 by the patriotic play, <i>Le Siège de Calais</i>. The
moment was opportune. The humiliations undergone by France
in the Seven Years&rsquo; War assured a good reception for a play in
which the devotion of Frenchmen redeemed disaster. The
popular enthusiasm was unaffected by the judgment of calmer
critics such as Diderot and Voltaire, who pointed out that the
glorification of France was not best effected by a picture of
defeat. De Belloy was admitted to the Academy in 1772. His
attempt to introduce national subjects into French drama
deserves honour, but it must be confessed that his resources
proved unequal to the task. The <i>Siège de Calais</i> was followed by
<i>Gaston et Bayard</i> (1771), <i>Pedro le cruel</i> (1772) and <i>Gabrielle de
Vergy</i> (1777). None of these attained the success of the earlier
play, and de Belloy&rsquo;s death, which took place on the 5th of March
1775, is said to have been hastened by disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELL<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> or <b>INCHCAPE ROCK,</b> a sandstone reef in the North Sea,
11 m. S.E. of Arbroath, belonging to Forfarshire, Scotland. It
measures 2000 ft. in length, is under water at high tide, but at
low tide is exposed for a few feet, the sea for a distance of 100 yds.
around being then only three fathoms deep. Lying in the fairway
of vessels making or leaving the Tay and Forth, besides
ports farther north, it was a constant menace to navigation.
In the great gale of 1799 seventy sail, including the &ldquo;York,&rdquo;
74 guns, were wrecked off the reef, and this disaster compelled the
authorities to take steps to protect shipping. Next year Robert
Stevenson modelled a tower and reported that its erection was
feasible, but it was only in 1806 that parliamentary powers were
obtained, and operations began in August 1807. Though John
Rennie had meanwhile been associated with Stevenson as
consulting engineer, the structure in design and details is wholly
Stevenson&rsquo;s work. The tower is 100 ft. high; its diameter at the
base is 42 ft., decreasing to 15 ft. at the top. It is solid for 30 ft.
at which height the doorway is placed. The interior is divided
into six storeys. After five years the building was finished at a
cost of £61,300. Since the lighting no wrecks have occurred on
the reef. A bust of Stevenson by Samuel Joseph (d. 1850) was
placed in the tower.</p>

<p>According to tradition an abbot of Aberbrothock (Arbroath)
had ordered a bell&mdash;whence the name of the rock&mdash;to be fastened
to the reef in such a way that it should respond to the movements
of the waves, and thus always ring out a warning to mariners.
This signal was wantonly destroyed by a pirate, whose ship was
afterwards wrecked at this very spot, the rover and his men
being drowned. Southey made the incident the subject of his
ballad of &ldquo;The Inchcape Rock.&rdquo;</p>

confluence with the Ardo, 1285 ft. above sea-level, among the
lower Venetian Alps. It was a Roman <i>municipium</i>. In the
middle ages it went through various vicissitudes; it fell under
the dominion of Venice in 1511, and remained Venetian until
1797. Its buildings present Venetian characteristics; it has
some good palaces, notably the fine early Lombard Renaissance
Palazzo dei Rettori, now the seat of the prefecture. The cathedral,
erected after 1517 by Tullio Lombardo, was much damaged
by the earthquake of 1873, which destroyed a considerable
portion of the town, though the campanile, 217 ft. high, erected
in 1732-1743, stood firm. The façade was never finished.

December 1816. He entered the banking house of the Rothschilds
at Frankfort at the age of fourteen, acted as their agent
for a time at Naples, and in 1837 settled in New York as their
American representative. He became an American citizen,
and married a daughter of Commodore Matthew C. Perry. He
was the consul-general of Austria at New York from 1844 to
1850, when he resigned in protest against Austria&rsquo;s treatment of
Hungary. In 1853-1855 he was chargé d&rsquo;affaires for the United
States at the Hague, and from 1855 to 1858 was the American
minister resident there. In 1860 he was a delegate to the
Democratic National Convention at Charleston, South Carolina,
actively supporting Stephen A. Douglas for the presidential
nomination, and afterwards joining those who withdrew to the
convention at Baltimore, Maryland, where he was chosen chairman
of the National Democratic Committee. He energetically
supported the Union cause during the Civil War, and exerted a
strong influence in favour of the North upon the merchants and
financiers of England and France. He remained at the head of
the Democratic organization until 1872. He died in New York

<p><span class="bold">BELPER,<a name="ar147" id="ar147"></a></span> a market-town in the mid-parliamentary division
of Derbyshire, England, on the river Derwent, 7 m. N. of Derby
on the Midland railway. Pop. of urban district (1901), 10,934.
The chapel of St John is said to have been founded by Edmund
Crouchback, second son of Henry III., about the middle of the
13th century. There is an Anglican convent of the Sisters of
St Lawrence, with orphanage and school. For a considerable
period one of the most flourishing towns in the county, Belper
owed its prosperity to the establishment of cotton works in 1776
by Messrs Strutt, the title of Baron Belper (cr. 1856), in the
Strutt family, being taken from the town. Belper also manufactures
linen, hosiery, silk and earthenware; and after the
decline of nail-making, once an important industry, engineering
works and iron foundries were opened. The Derwent provides
water-power for the cotton-mills. John of Gaunt is said to have
been a great benefactor to Belper, and the foundations of a
massive building have been believed to mark the site of his
residence. A chapel which he founded is incorporated with a
modern schoolhouse. The scenery in the neighbourhood of
Belper, especially to the west, is beautiful; but there are
collieries, lead-mines and quarries in the vicinity of the town.</p>

<p>Belper (Beaurepaire) until 1846 formed part of the parish of
Duffield, granted by William I. to Henry de Ferrers, earl of
Derby. There is no distinct mention of Belper till 1296, when
the manor was held by Edmund Crouchback, earl of Lancaster,
who is said to have enclosed a park and built a hunting seat,
to which, from its situation, he gave the name Beaurepaire.
The manor thus became parcel of the duchy of Lancaster and is
said to have been the residence of John of Gaunt. It afterwards
passed with Duffield to the Jodrell family. In a great storm in
1545, 40 houses were destroyed, and the place was scourged by
the plague in 1609.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELSHAM, THOMAS<a name="ar148" id="ar148"></a></span> (1750-1829), English Unitarian minister,
was born at Bedford on the 26th of April 1750. He was educated
at the dissenting academy at Daventry, where for seven years
he acted as assistant tutor. After three years spent in a charge
at Worcester, he returned as head of the Daventry academy, a
post which he continued to hold till 1789, when, having adopted
Unitarian principles, he resigned. With Joseph Priestly for
colleague, he superintended during its brief existence a new
college at Hackney, and was, on Priestly&rsquo;s departure in 1794,
also called to the charge of the Gravel Pit congregation. In
1805 he accepted a call to the Essex Street chapel, where in
gradually failing health he remained till his death in 1829.
Belsham&rsquo;s first work of importance, <i>Review of Mr Wilberforce&rsquo;s
Treatise entitled Practical View</i> (1798), was written after his
conversion to Unitarianism. His most popular work was the
<i>Evidences of Christianity;</i> the most important was his translation
and exposition of the Epistles of St Paul (1822). He was
also the author of a work on philosophy, <i>Elements of the Philosophy
of the Human Mind</i> (1801), which is entirely based on Hartley&rsquo;s
psychology. Belsham is one of the most vigorous and able
writers of his church, and the <i>Quarterly Review</i> and <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> of the early years of the 19th century abound in
evidences that his abilities were recognized by his opponents.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BELSHAZZAR<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span> (6th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Babylonian general. Until
the decipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions, he was known
only from the book of Daniel (v. 2, 11, 13, 18) and its reproduction
in Josephus, where he is represented as the son of Nebuchadrezzar
and the last king of Babylon. As his name did not appear
in the list of the successors of Nebuchadrezzar handed down by
the Greek writers, various suggestions were put forward as to
his identity. Niebuhr identified him  with Evil-Merodach, Ewald
with Nabonidos, others again with Neriglissor. The identification
with Nabonidos, the last Babylonian king according to the
native historian Berossus, goes back to Josephus. The decipherment
of the cuneiform texts put an end to all such speculations. In 1854
Sir H.C. Rawlinson discovered the name of Bel-sarra-uzur&mdash;&ldquo;O Bel,
defend the king&rdquo;&mdash;in an inscription belonging
to the first year of Nabonidos which had been discovered in the
ruins of the temple of the Moon-god at Muqayyar or Ur. Here
Nabonidos calls him his &ldquo;first-born son,&rdquo; and prays that &ldquo;he
may not give way to sin,&rdquo; but that &ldquo;the fear of the great
divinity&rdquo; of the Moon-god may &ldquo;dwell in his heart.&rdquo; In the
contracts and similar documents there are frequent references
to Belshazzar, who is sometimes entitled simply &ldquo;the son of the
king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was never king himself, nor was he son of Nebuchadrezzar.
Indeed his father Nabonidos (Nabunaid), the son of Nabu-baladsu-iqbi,
was not related to the family of Nebuchadrezzar
and owed his accession to the throne to a palace revolution.
Belshazzar, however, seems to have had more political and
military energy than his father, whose tastes were antiquarian
and religious; he took command of the army, living with it in the
camp near Sippara, and whatever measures of defence were
organized against the invasion of Cyrus appear to have been
due to him. Hence Jewish tradition substituted him for his
less-known father, and rightly concluded that his death marked
the fall of the Babylonian monarchy. We learn from the
Babylonian Chronicle that from the 7th year of Nabonidos
(548 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) onwards &ldquo;the son of the king&rdquo; was with the army in
Akkad, that is in the close neighbourhood of Sippara. This,
as Dr Th. G. Pinches has pointed out, doubtless accounts for the
numerous gifts bestowed by him on the temple of the Sun-god
at Sippara. So late as the 5th of Ab in the 17th year of
Nabonidos&mdash;that is to say, about three weeks after the forces of Cyrus
had entered Babylonia and only three months before his death&mdash;we
find him paying 47 shekels of silver to the temple on behalf
of his sister, this being the amount of &ldquo;tithe&rdquo; due from her at
the time. At an earlier period there is frequent mention of his
trading transactions which were carried out through his house-steward
or agent. Thus in 545 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> he lent 20 manehs of silver
to a private individual, a Persian by race, on the security of
the property of the latter, and a year later his house-steward
negotiated a loan of 16 shekels, taking as security the produce
of a field of corn.</p>

<p>The legends of Belshazzar&rsquo;s feast and of the siege and capture
of Babylon by Cyrus which have come down to us from the book
of Daniel and the <i>Cyropaedia</i> of Xenophon have been shown by
the contemporaneous inscriptions to have been a projection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page712" id="page712"></a>712</span>
backwards of the re-conquest of the city by Darius Hystaspis.
The actual facts were very different. Cyrus had invaded
Babylonia from two directions, he himself marching towards the
confluence of the Tigris and Diyaleh, while Gobryas, the satrap
of Kurdistan, led another body of troops along the course of the
Adhem. The portion of the Babylonian army to which the
protection of the eastern frontier had been entrusted was defeated
at Opis on the banks of the Nizallat, and the invaders
poured across the Tigris into Babylonia. On the 14th of Tammuz
(June), 538 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, Nabonidos fled from Sippara, where he had
taken his son&rsquo;s place in the camp, and the city surrendered at
once to the enemy. Meanwhile Gobryas had been despatched
to Babylon, which opened its gates to the invader on the 16th
of the month &ldquo;without combat or battle,&rdquo; and a few days later
Nabonidos was dragged from his hiding-place and made a prisoner.
According to Berossus he was subsequently appointed governor
of Karmania by his conqueror. Belshazzar, however, still held
out, and it was probably on this account that Cyrus himself did
not arrive at Babylon until nearly four months later, on the
3rd of Marchesvan. On the 11th of that month Gobryas was
despatched to put an end to the last semblance of resistance in
the country &ldquo;and the son (?) of the king died.&rdquo; In accordance
with the conciliatory policy of Cyrus, a general mourning was
proclaimed on account of his death, and this lasted for six days,
from the 27th of Adar to the 3rd of Nisan. Unfortunately the
character representing the word &ldquo;son&rdquo; is indistinct on the tablet
which contains the annals of Nabonidos, so that the reading is
not absolutely certain. The only other reading possible, however,
is &ldquo;and the king died,&rdquo; and this reading is excluded partly by
the fact that Nabonidos afterwards became a Persian satrap,
partly by the silence which would otherwise be maintained by
the &ldquo;Annals&rdquo; in regard to the fate of Belshazzar. Considering
how important Belshazzar was politically, and what a prominent
place he occupied in the history of the period, such a silence
would be hard to explain. His death subsequently to the
surrender of Babylon and the capture of Nabonidos, and with it
the last native effort to resist the invader, would account for the
position he assumed in later tradition and the substitution of his
name for that of the actual king.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELT, THOMAS<a name="ar150" id="ar150"></a></span> (1832-1878), English geologist and naturalist,
was born at Newcastle-on-Tyne in 1832, and educated in that
city. As a youth he became actively interested in natural
history through the Tyneside Naturalists&rsquo; Field Club. In 1852
he went to Australia and for about eight years worked at the
gold-diggings, where he acquired a practical knowledge of ore-deposits.
In 1860 he proceeded to Nova Scotia to take charge
of some gold-mines, and there met with a serious injury, which
led to his return to England. In 1861 he issued a separate work
entitled <i>Mineral Veins: an Enquiry into their Origin, founded on
a Study of the Auriferous Quartz Veins of Australia</i>. Later on he was
engaged for about three years at Dolgelly, another though small
gold-mining region, and here he carefully investigated the rocks
and fossils of the Lingula Flags, his observations being published
in an important and now classic memoir in the <i>Geological Magazine</i>
for 1867. In the following year he was appointed to take
charge of some mines in Nicaragua, where he passed four active
and adventurous years&mdash;the results being given in his <i>Naturalist
in Nicaragua</i> (1874), a work of high merit. In this volume the
author expressed his views on the former presence of glaciers in
that country. In subsequent papers he dealt boldly and suggestively
with the phenomena of the Glacial period in Britain
and in various parts of the world. After many further expeditions
to Russia, Siberia and Colorado, he died at Denver on the
21st of September 1878.</p>

form being <i>balz</i>, from which the Lat. <i>balteus</i> probably derived),
a flat strap of leather or other material used as a girdle (<i>q.v.</i>),
especially the <i>cinctura gladii</i> or sword-belt, the chief &ldquo;ornament
of investiture&rdquo; of an earl or knight; in machinery, a flexible
strap passing round from one drum, pulley or wheel to another,
for the purpose of power-transmission (<i>q.v.</i>). The word is applied
to any broad stripe, to the belts of the planet Jupiter, to the
armour-belt at the water-line of a warship, or to a tract of
country, narrow in proportion to its length, with special distinguishing
characteristics, such as the earthquake-belt across
a continent.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELTANE,<a name="ar152" id="ar152"></a></span> <span class="sc">Beltene, Beltine</span>, or <span class="sc">Beal-Tene</span> (Scottish
Gaelic, <i>bealltain</i>), the Celtic name for May-day, on which also was
held a festival called by the same name, originally common to
all the Celtic peoples, of which traces still linger in Ireland, the
Highlands of Scotland and Brittany. This festival, the most
important ceremony of which in later centuries was the lighting
of the bonfires known as &ldquo;beltane fires,&rdquo; is believed to represent
the Druidical worship of the sun-god. The fuel was piled on a
hill-top, and at the fire the beltane cake was cooked. This was
divided into pieces corresponding to the number of those present,
and one piece was blackened with charcoal. For these pieces
lots were drawn, and he who had the misfortune to get the black
bit became <i>cailleach bealtine</i> (the beltane carline)&mdash;a term of
great reproach. He was pelted with egg-shells, and afterwards
for some weeks was spoken of as dead. In the north-east of
Scotland beltane fires were still kindled in the latter half of the
18th century. There were many superstitions connecting them
with the belief in witchcraft. According to Cormac, archbishop
of Cashel about the year 908, who furnishes in his glossary the
earliest notice of beltane, it was customary to light two fires
close together, and between these both men and cattle were
driven, under the belief that health was thereby promoted and
disease warded off. (See <i>Transactions of the Irish Academy</i>,
xiv. pp. 100, 122, 123.) The Highlanders have a proverb, &ldquo;he is
between two beltane fires.&rdquo; The Strathspey Highlanders used
to make a hoop of rowan wood through which on beltane day
they drove the sheep and lambs both at dawn and sunset.</p>

<p>As to the derivation of the word beltane there is considerable
obscurity. Following Cormac, it has been usual to regard it as
representing a combination of the name of the god Bel or Baal
or Bil with the Celtic <i>teine</i>, fire. And on this etymology theories
have been erected of the connexion of the Semitic Baal with
Celtic mythology, and the identification of the beltane fires with
the worship of this deity. This etymology is now repudiated
by scientific philologists, and the <i>New English Dictionary</i> accepts
Dr Whitley Stokes&rsquo;s view that beltane in its Gaelic form can have
no connexion with <i>teine</i>, fire. Beltane, as the 1st of May, was
in ancient Scotland one of the four quarter days, the others being
Hallowmas, Candlemas, and Lammas.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BELZONI, GIOVANNI BATTISTA<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span> (1778-1823), Italian
explorer of Egyptian antiquities, was born at Padua in 1778.
His family was from Rome, and in that city he spent his youth.
He intended taking monastic orders, but in 1798 the occupation
of the city by the French troops drove him from Rome and
changed his proposed career. He went back to Padua, where
he studied hydraulics, removed in 1800 to Holland, and in 1803
went to England, where he married an Englishwoman. He was
6 ft. 7 in. in height, broad in proportion, and his wife was of
equally generous build. They were for some time compelled
to find subsistence by exhibitions of feats of strength and agility
at fairs and on the streets of London. Through the kindness
of Henry Salt, the traveller and antiquarian, who was ever
afterwards his patron, he was engaged at Astley&rsquo;s amphitheatre,
and his circumstances soon began to improve. In 1812 he left
England, and after travelling in Spain and Portugal reached
Egypt in 1815, where Salt was then British consul-general.
Belzoni was desirous of laying before Mehemet Ali a hydraulic
machine of his own invention for raising the waters of the Nile.
Though the experiment with this engine was successful, the
design was abandoned by the pasha, and Belzoni resolved to
continue his travels. On the recommendation of the orientalist,
J.L. Burckhardt, he was sent at Salt&rsquo;s charges to Thebes, whence
he removed with great skill the colossal bust of Rameses II.,
commonly called Young Memnon, which he shipped for England,
where it is in the British Museum. He also pushed his investigations
into the great temple of Edfu, visited Elephantine and
Philae, cleared the great temple at Abu Simbel of sand (1817),
made excavations at Karnak, and opened up the sepulchre of
Seti I. (&ldquo;Belzoni&rsquo;s Tomb&rdquo;). He was the first to penetrate into
the second pyramid of Giza, and the first European in modern
times to visit the oasis of Baharia, which he supposed to be that
of Siwa. He also identified the ruins of Berenice on the Red Sea.
In 1819 he returned to England, and published in the following
year an account of his travels and discoveries entitled <i>Narrative
of the Operations and Recent Discoveries within the Pyramids,
Temples, Tombs and Excavations in Egypt and Nubia, &amp;c.</i> He
also exhibited during 1820-1821 facsimiles of the tomb of Seti I.
The exhibition was held at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, London.
In 1822 Belzoni showed his model in Paris. In 1823 he set out
for West Africa, intending to penetrate to Timbuktu. Having
been refused permission to pass through Morocco, he chose the
Guinea Coast route. He reached Benin, but was seized with
dysentery at a village called Gwato, and died there on the 3rd
of December 1823. In 1829 his widow published his drawings
of the royal tombs at Thebes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BEM, JOSEF<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> (1795-1850), Polish soldier, was born at Tarnow
in Galicia, and was educated at the military school at Warsaw,
where he especially distinguished himself in mathematics.
Joining a Polish artillery regiment in the French service, he took
part in the Russian campaign of 1812, and subsequently so
brilliantly distinguished himself in the defence of Danzig
(January-November 1813) that he won the cross of the Legion
of Honour. On returning to Poland he was for a time in the
Russian service, but lost his post, and his liberty as well for some
time, for his outspokenness. In 1825 he migrated to Lemberg,
where he taught the physical sciences. He was about to write a
treatise on the steam-engine, when the Polish War of Independence
summoned him back to Warsaw in November 1830. It was
his skill as an artillery officer which won for the Polish general
Skrynecki the battle of Igany (March 8, 1831), and he distinguished
himself at the indecisive battle of Ostrolenká (May 26).
He took part in the desperate defence of Warsaw against Prince
Paskievich (September 6-7, 1831). Then Bem escaped to Paris,
where he supported himself by teaching mathematics. In 1833
he went to Portugal to assist the liberal Dom Pedro against the
reactionary Dom Miguel, but abandoned the idea when it was
found that a Polish legion could not be formed. A wider field for
his activity presented itself in 1848. First he attempted to hold
Vienna against the imperial troops, and, after the capitulation,
hastened to Pressburg to offer his services to Kossuth, first
defending himself, in a long memorial, from the accusations
of treachery to the Polish cause and of aristocratic tendencies
which the more fanatical section of the Polish emigrant Radicals
repeatedly brought against him. He was entrusted with the
defence of Transylvania at the end of 1848, and in 1849, as the
general of the Szeklers (<i>q.v.</i>), he performed miracles with his little
army, notably at the bridge of Piski (February 9), where, after
fighting all day, he drove back an immense force of pursuers.
After recovering Transylvania he was sent to drive the Austrian
general Puchner out of the Banat of Temesvár. Bem defeated
him at Orsova (May 16), but the Russian invasion recalled him
to Transylvania. From the 12th to 22nd of July he was fighting
continually, but finally, on the 31st of July, his army was
annihilated by overwhelming numbers near Segesvár (Schässburg),
Bem only escaping by feigning death. Yet he fought a
fresh action at Gross-Scheueren on the 6th of August, and
contrived to bring off the fragments of his host to Temesvár, to
aid the hardly-pressed Dembinski. Bem was in command and
was seriously wounded in the last pitched battle of the war,
fought there on the 9th of August. On the collapse of the
rebellion he fled to Turkey, adopted Mahommedanism, and
under the name of Murad Pasha served as governor of Aleppo,
at which place, at the risk of his life, he saved the Christian
population from being massacred by the Moslems. Here he
died on the 16th of September 1850. The tiny, withered, sickly
body of Bem was animated by an heroic temper. Few men have
been so courageous, and his influence was magnetic. Even the
rough Szeklers, though they did not understand the language
of their &ldquo;little father,&rdquo; regarded him with superstitious reverence.
A statue to his honour has been erected at Maros-Vásárhely,
but he lives still more enduringly in the immortal verses of the
patriot poet Sandor Petöfi, who fell in the fatal action of the 31st
of July at Segesvár. As a soldier Bem was remarkable for his
excellent handling of artillery and the rapidity of his marches.</p>

was a stone platform from 10 to 11 ft. in height. Again in the
Athenian law court counsel addressed the court from such a
platform: it is not known whether each had a separate bema
or whether there was only one to which each counsel (? and the
witnesses) in turn ascended (cf. W. Wyse in his edition of Isaeus,
p. 440). Another bema was the platform on which stood the
urns for the reception of the bronze disks (<span class="grk" title="psiaephoi">&#968;&#8134;&#966;&#959;&#953;</span>) by means of

<p><span class="bold">BEMBO, PIETRO<a name="ar160" id="ar160"></a></span> (1470-1547), Italian cardinal and scholar,
was born at Venice on the 20th of May 1470. While still a boy he
accompanied his father to Florence, and there acquired a love for
that Tuscan form of speech which he afterwards cultivated in
preference to the dialect of his native city. Having completed
his studies, which included two years&rsquo; devotion to Greek under
Lascaris at Messina, he chose the ecclesiastical profession. After
a considerable time spent in various cities and courts of Italy,
where his learning already made him welcome, he accompanied
Giulio de&rsquo; Medici to Rome, where he was soon after appointed
secretary to Leo X. On the pontiff&rsquo;s death he retired, with
impaired health, to Padua, and there lived for a number of years
engaged in literary labours and amusements. In 1529 he accepted
the office of historiographer to his native city, and shortly
afterwards was appointed librarian of St Mark&rsquo;s. The offer of a
cardinal&rsquo;s hat by Pope Paul III. took him in 1539 again to Rome,
where he renounced the study of classical literature and devoted
himself to theology and classical history, receiving before long
the reward of his conversion in the shape of the bishoprics of
Gubbio and Bergamo. He died on the 18th of January 1547.
Bembo, as a writer, is the <i>beau ideal</i> of a purist. The exact
imitation of the style of the genuine classics was the highest
perfection at which he aimed. This at once prevented the graces
of spontaneity and secured the beauties of artistic elaboration.
One cannot fail to be struck with the Ciceronian cadence that
guides the movement even of his Italian writings.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His works (collected edition, Venice, 1729) include a <i>History of
Venice</i> (1551) from 1487 to 1513, dialogues, poems, and what we
would now call essays. Perhaps the most famous are a little treatise
on Italian prose, and a dialogue entitled <i>Gli Asolani</i>, in which
Platonic affection is explained and recommended in a rather long-winded
fashion, to the amusement of the reader who remembers the
relations of the beautiful Morosina with the author. The edition of
Petrarch&rsquo;s <i>Italian Poems</i>, published by Aldus in 1501, and the
<i>Terzerime</i>, which issued from the same press in 1502, were edited
by Bembo, who was on intimate terms with the great typographer.

<p><span class="bold">BENARES,<a name="ar165" id="ar165"></a></span> the Holy City of the Hindus, which gives its name

its ancient name <i>Varanasi</i> is not known, nor is that of its alternative
name <i>Kasi</i>, which is still in common use among Hindus,
and is popularly explained to mean &ldquo;bright.&rdquo; The original site
of the city is supposed to have been at Sarnath, 3½ m. north of
the present city, where ruins of brick and stone buildings, with
three lofty <i>stupas</i> still standing, cover an area about half a mile
long by a quarter broad. Sakya Muni, the Buddha, came here
from Gaya in the 6th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (from which time some of the
remains may date), in order to establish his religion, which shows
that the place was even then a great centre. Hsüan Tsang, the
celebrated Chinese pilgrim, visited Benares in the 7th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>
and described it as containing 30 Buddhist monasteries, with
about 3000 monks, and about 100 temples of Hindu gods.
Hinduism has now supplanted Buddhism, and the Brahman fills
the place of the monk. The modern temples number upwards
of 1500. Even after the lapse of so great a time the city is still
in its glory, and as seen from the river it presents a scene of great
picturesqueness and grandeur. The Ganges here forms a fine
sweep of about 4 m. in length, the city being situated on the
outside of the curve, on the northern bank of the river, which is
higher than the other. Being thus elevated, and extending
along the river for some 4 m., the city forms a magnificent
panorama of buildings in many varieties of oriental architecture.
The minarets of the mosque of Aurangzeb rise above all. The
bank of the river is entirely lined with stone, and there are many
very fine ghats or landing-places built by pious devotees, and
highly ornamented. These are generally crowded with bathers
and worshippers, who come to wash away their sins in the sacred
river Ganges. Near the Manikarnika ghat is the well held to
have been dug by Vishnu and filled with his sweat; great
numbers of pilgrims bathe in its venerated water. Shrines and
temples line the bank of the river. But in spite of its fine
appearance from the river, the architecture of Benares is not
distinguished, nor are its buildings of high antiquity. Among
the most conspicuous of these are the mosque of Aurangzeb,
built as an intentional insult in the middle of the Hindu quarter;
the Bisheshwar or Golden Temple, important less through
architectural beauty than through its rank as the holiest spot
in the holy city; and the Durga temple, which, like most of the
other principal temples, is a Mahratta building of the 17th
century. The temples are mostly small and are placed in the
angles of the streets, under the shadow of the lofty houses.
Their forms are not ungraceful, and many of them are covered
over with beautiful and elaborate carvings of flowers, animals
and palm branches. The observatory of Raja Jai Singh is a
notable building of the year 1693. The internal streets of the
town are so winding and narrow that there is not room for a
carriage to pass, and it is difficult to penetrate them even on
horseback. The level of the roadway is considerably lower than
the ground-floors of the houses, which have generally arched
rooms in front, with little shops behind them; and above these
they are richly embellished with verandahs, galleries, projecting
oriel windows, and very broad overhanging eaves supported by
carved brackets. The houses are built of <i>chanar</i> stone, and are
lofty, none being less than two storeys high, most of them three,
and several of five or six storeys. The Hindus are fond of painting
the outside of their houses a deep red colour, and of covering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page715" id="page715"></a>715</span>
the most conspicuous parts with pictures of flowers, men, women,
bulls, elephants and gods and goddesses in all the many forms
known in Hindu mythology.</p>

<p>Benares is bounded by a road which, though 50 m. in circuit,
is never distant from the city more than five kos (7½ m.); hence
its name, Panch-kos road. All who die within this boundary,
be they Brahman or low caste, Moslem or Christian, are sure of
admittance into Siva&rsquo;s heaven. To tread the Panch-kos road is
one of the great ambitions of a Hindu&rsquo;s life. Even if he be an
inhabitant of the sacred city he must traverse it once in the
year to free himself from the impurities and sins contracted
within the holy precincts. Thousands from all parts of India
make the pilgrimage every year. Benares, having from time
immemorial been a holy city, contains a vast number of Brahmans,
who either subsist by charitable contributions, or are
supported by endowments in the numerous religious institutions
of the city. Hindu religious mendicants, with every conceivable
bodily deformity, line the principal streets on both sides. Some
have their legs or arms distorted by long continuance in one
position; others have kept their hands clenched until the finger
nails have pierced entirely through their hands. But besides an
immense resort to Benares of poor pilgrims from every part of
India, as well as from Tibet and Burma, numbers of rich Hindus
in the decline of life go there for religious salvation. These
devotees lavish large sums in indiscriminate charity, and it is
the hope of sharing in such pious distributions that brings
together the concourse of religious mendicants from all quarters
of the country.</p>

<p>The city of Benares had a population in 1901 of 209,331.
The European quarter lies to the west of the native town, on both
sides of the river Barna. Here is the cantonment of Sikraul, no
longer of much military importance, and the suburb of Sigra,
the seat of the chief missionary institutions. The principal
modern buildings are the Mint, the Prince of Wales&rsquo; hospital
(commemorating the visit of King Edward VII. to the city in
1876) and the town hall. The Benares college, including a first-grade
and a Sanskrit college, was opened in 1791, but its fine
buildings date from 1852. The Central Hindu College was opened
in 1898. Benares conducts a flourishing trade by rail and river
with the surrounding country. It is the junction between the
Oudh &amp; Rohilkhand and East Indian railways, the Ganges being
crossed by a steel girder bridge of seven spans, each 350 ft. long.
The chief manufactures are silk brocades, gold and silver thread,
gold filigree work, German-silver work, embossed brass vessels
and lacquered toys; but the brasswork for which Benares used
to be famous has greatly degenerated.</p>

<p>The Hindu kingdom of Benares is said to have been founded
by one Kas Raja about 1200 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Subsequently it became part
of the kingdom of Kanauj, which in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1193 was conquered by
Mahommed of Ghor. On the downfall of the Pathan dynasty
of Delhi, about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1599, it was incorporated with the Mogul
empire. On the dismemberment of the Delhi empire, it was
seized by Safdar Jang, the nawab wazir of Oudh, by whose
grandson it was ceded to the East India Company by the treaty
of 1775. The subsequent history of Benares contains two
important events, the rebellion of Chait Singh in 1781, occasioned
by the demands of Warren Hastings for money and troops
to carry on the Mahratta War, and the Mutiny of 1857, when the
energy and coolness of the European officials, chiefly of General
Neill, carried the district successfully through the storm.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">District of Benares</span> extends over both sides of the
Ganges and has an area of 1008 sq. m. The surface of the
country is remarkably level, with numerous deep ravines in the
calcareous conglomerate. The soil is a clayey or a sandy loam,
and very fertile except in the Usar tracts, where there is a saline
efflorescence. The principal rivers are the Ganges, Karamnasa,
Gumti and Barna. The principal crops are barley, rice, wheat,
other food-grains, pulse, sugar-cane and opium. The main line
of the East Indian railway runs through the southern portion of
the district, with a branch to Benares city; the Oudh &amp;
Rohilkhand railway through the northern portion, starting from
the city; and a branch of the Bengal &amp; North-Western railway
also terminates at Benares. The climate of Benares is cool in
winter but very warm in the hot season. The population in
1901 was 882,084, showing a decrease of 4% in the decade due
to the effects of famine.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Division of Benares</span> has an area of 10,431 sq. m., and
comprises the districts of Benares, Mirzapur, Jaunpur, Ghazipur
and Ballia. In 1901 the population was 5,069,020, showing a
decrease of 6% in the decade.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENBOW, JOHN<a name="ar166" id="ar166"></a></span> (1653-1702), English admiral, the son of a
tanner in Shrewsbury, was born in 1653. He went to sea when
very young, and served in the navy as master&rsquo;s mate and master,
from 1678 to 1681. When trading to the Mediterranean in 1686 in
a ship of his own he beat off a Salli pirate. On the accession of
William III. he re-entered the navy as a lieutenant and was
rapidly promoted. It is probable that he enjoyed the protection
of Arthur Herbert, earl of Torrington, under whom he had
already served in the Mediterranean. After taking part in the
bombardment of St Malo (1693), and superintending the blockade
of Dunkirk (1696), he sailed in 1698 for the West Indies, where he
compelled the Spaniards to restore two vessels belonging to the
Scottish colonists at Darien (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Paterson, William</a></span>) which they
had seized. On his return he was appointed vice-admiral, and
was frequently consulted by the king. In 1701 he was sent again
to the West Indies as commander-in-chief. On the 19th of
August 1702, when cruising with a squadron of seven ships, he
sighted, and chased, four French vessels commanded by M. du
Casse near Santa Marta. The engagement is the most disgraceful
episode in English naval history. Benbow&rsquo;s captains were
mutinous, and he was left unsupported in his flagship the
&ldquo;Breda.&rdquo; His right leg was shattered by a chain-shot, despite
which he remained on the quarter-deck till morning, when the
flagrant disobedience of the captains under him, and the disabled
condition of his ship, forced him reluctantly to abandon the chase.
After his return to Jamaica, where his subordinates were tried by
court-martial, he died of his wounds on the 4th of November
1702. A great deal of legendary matter has collected round his
name, and his life is really obscure.</p>

son of an officer in the dragoon guards. He was educated at
Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge. Subsequently he studied
medicine at St George&rsquo;s hospital, and chemistry at University
College, London. In 1841 he went to Giessen in Germany to work
at chemistry with Liebig. Besides becoming a fellow, and afterwards
senior censor, of the Royal College of Physicians, and a
fellow of the Royal Society, he held the post of secretary to the
Royal Institution for many years. In 1846 he was elected
physician to St George&rsquo;s hospital. He died in London on the
20th of April 1873. Dr Bence-Jones was a recognized authority

<p><span class="bold">BENCH<a name="ar168" id="ar168"></a></span> (an O. E. and Eng. form of a word common to Teutonic
languages, cf. Ger. <i>Bank</i>, Dan. <i>baenk</i> and the Eng. doublet
&ldquo;bank&rdquo;), a long narrow wooden seat for several persons, with or
without a back. While the chair was yet a seat of state or dignity
the bench was ordinarily used by the commonalty. It is still
extensively employed for other than domestic purposes, as in
schools, churches and places of amusement. Bench or Banc, in
law, originally was the seat occupied by judges in court; hence
the term is used of a tribunal of justice itself, as the King&rsquo;s Bench,
the Common Bench, and is now applied to judges or magistrates
collectively as the &ldquo;judicial bench,&rdquo; &ldquo;bench of magistrates.&rdquo;
The word is also applied to any seat where a number of people sit
in an official capacity, or as equivalent to the dignity itself, as
&ldquo;the civic bench,&rdquo; the &ldquo;bench of aldermen,&rdquo; the &ldquo;episcopal
bench,&rdquo; the &ldquo;front bench,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> that reserved for the leaders of
either party in the British House of Commons. King&rsquo;s Bench
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page716" id="page716"></a>716</span>
(<i>q.v</i>.) was one of the three superior courts of common law at
Westminster, the others being the common pleas and the exchequer.
Under the Judicature Act 1873, the court of king&rsquo;s
bench became the king&rsquo;s bench division of the High Court of
Justice. The court of common pleas was sometimes called the
common bench.</p>

<p>Sittings in bane were formerly the sittings of one of the superior
courts of Westminster for the hearing of motions, special cases,
&amp;c., as opposed to the <i>nisi prius</i> sittings for trial of facts, where
usually only a single judge presided. By the Judicature Act
1873 the business of courts sitting in bane was transferred to
divisional courts.</p>

&ldquo;angle-iron&rdquo; which is inserted in the horizontal incision as a

<p><span class="bold">BENDA,<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span> the name of a family of German musicians, of whom
the most important is Georg (d. 1795), who was a pupil of his
elder brother Franz (1709-1786), <i>Concertmeister</i> in Berlin.
Georg Benda was a famous clavier player and oboist, but his
chief interest for modern musical history lies in his melodramas.
Being a far more solid musician than Rousseau he earns the
title of the musical pioneer of that art-form (<i>i.e.</i> the accompaniment
of spoken words by illustrative music) in a sense which
cannot be claimed for Rousseau&rsquo;s earlier <i>Pygmalion</i>. Benda&rsquo;s
first melodrama, <i>Ariadne auf Naxos</i>, was written in 1774 after
his return from a visit to Italy. He was a voluminous composer,
whose works (instrumental and dramatic) were enthusiastically
taken up by the aristocracy in the time of Mozart. Mozart&rsquo;s
imagination was much fired by Benda&rsquo;s new vehicle for dramatic
expression, and in 1778 he wrote to his father with the greatest
enthusiasm about a project for composing a duodrama on the
model of Benda&rsquo;s <i>Ariadne auf Naxos</i> and <i>Medea</i>, both of which
he considered excellent and always carried about with him. He
concluded at the time that that was the way the problems of
operatic recitative should be solved, or rather shelved, but the
only specimen he has himself produced is the wonderful melodrama
in his unfinished operetta, <i>Zaide</i>, written in 1780.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENDER<a name="ar173" id="ar173"></a></span> (more correctly <span class="sc">Bendery</span>), a town of Russia, in the
government of Bessarabia, on the right bank of the Dniester,
37 m. by rail S.E. of Kishinev. It possesses a tobacco factory,
candle-works and brick-kilns, and is an important river port,
vessels discharging here their cargoes of corn, wine, wool, cattle,
flour and tallow, to be conveyed by land to Odessa and to Yassy
in Rumania. Timber also is floated down the Dniester. The
citadel was dismantled in 1897. The town had in 1867 a population
of 24,443, and in 1900 of 33,741, the greater proportion
being Jews. As early as the 12th century the Genoese had a
settlement on the site of Bender. In 1709 Charles XII., after
the defeat of Poltava, collected his forces here in a camp which
they called New Stockholm, and continued there till 1713.
Bender was taken by the Russians in 1770, in 1789 and in 1806,
but it was not held permanently by Russia till 1812.</p>

(1901) 31,020. It is the centre of a large gold-field consisting
of quartz ranges, with some alluvial deposits, and many of the
mines are deep-level workings. The discovery of alluvial gold
in 1851 brought many immigrants to the district; but the
opening up of the quartz reefs in 1872 was the principal factor
in the importance of Bendigo. It became a municipality in
1855 and a city in 1871. It is the seat of Anglican and Roman
Catholic bishops. Besides mining, the local industries are the
manufacture of Epsom pottery, bricks and tiles, iron-founding,
stone-cutting, brewing, tanning and coach-building. The surrounding

<p><span class="bold">BENDL, KAREL<a name="ar175" id="ar175"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Karl</span> (1838-1897), Bohemian composer,
was born on the 16th of April 1838 at Prague. He studied at
the organ school, and in 1858 had already composed a number
of small choral works. In 1861 his <i>Poletuje holubice</i> won a prize and at once became a favourite with the local choral societies.
In 1864 Bendl went to Brussels, where for a short time he held
the post of second conductor of the opera. After visiting
Amsterdam and Paris he returned to Prague. Here in 1865
he was appointed conductor of the choral society known as
<i>Hlahoe</i>, and he held the post until 1879, when Baron Dervies
engaged his services for his private band. Bendl&rsquo;s first opera
<i>Lejla</i> was successfully produced in 1868. It was followed by
<i>Bretislav a Jitka</i> (1870), <i>Stary Zenich</i>, a comic opera (1883),
<i>Karel Skreta</i> (1883), <i>Dite Tabera</i>, a prize opera (1892), and
<i>Matki Mila</i> (1891). Other operas by Bendl are <i>Indicka princezna,
Cernohorci</i>, a prize opera, and the two operas <i>Carovny
Kvet</i> and <i>Gina</i>. His ballad <i>Svanda dudak</i> acquired much
popularity; he published a mass in D minor for male voices and
another mass for a mixed choir; two songs to <i>Ave Maria</i>; a
violin sonata and a string quartet in F; and a quantity of songs
and choruses, many of which have come to be regarded as
national possessions of Bohemia. Bendl died on the 20th of
September 1897 at Prague.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENEDEK, LUDWIG,<a name="ar176" id="ar176"></a></span> <span class="sc">Ritter von</span> (1804-1881), Austrian
general, was born at Ödenburg in Hungary on the 14th of July
1804, his father being a doctor. He received his commission in
the Austrian army as ensign in 1822, becoming lieutenant in 1825,
first lieutenant in 1831 and captain in 1835. He was employed
for a considerable time in the general staff, and had risen to the
rank of colonel, when he won his first laurels in the suppression
of the rising of 1846 in Galicia (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Austria</a></span>: <i>History</i>). In this
campaign his bold leadership in the field and his capacity for
organization were so far conspicuous that he was made a <i>Ritter</i>
(knight) of the Leopold order by his sovereign, and a freeman
(<i>Ehrenbürger</i>) by the city of Lemberg. In 1847 he commanded
a regiment in Italy, and on the outbreak of war with Sardinia he
was placed in command of a mixed brigade, at the head of which
he displayed against regular troops the same qualities of unhesitating
bravery and resolution which had given him the
victory in many actions with the Galician rebels. His conduct at
Curtatone won for him the commandership of the Leopold order,
and shortly afterwards the knighthood of the Maria Theresa
order. At the action of Mortara his tactical skill and bravery
were again conspicuous, and Radetzky particularly distinguished
him in despatches. The archduke Albert, with whom he served,
is said to have given him the sword of his father, the great
archduke Charles. He was promoted major-general soon afterwards
over the heads of several colonels senior to him, and was
sent as a brigade commander to Hungary. Again he was
distinguished as a fighting general at Raab, Komorn, Szegedin
and many other actions, and was three times wounded. Benedek
then received the cross for military merit, and soon afterwards
was posted to the staff of the army in Italy. In 1852 he was made
lieutenant field marshal, and in 1857 commander successively of
the II., the IV. and the VIII. corps, and also a <i>Geheimrath</i>. In the
political crisis of 1854 he had command of a corps in the army of
observation under Hess on the Turkish frontier. In the war of
1859 in Italy, Benedek commanded the VIII. corps, and at the
battle of Solferino was in command of the right of the Austrian
position. That portion of the struggle which was fought out
between Benedek and the Piedmontese army is sometimes called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page717" id="page717"></a>717</span>
the battle of San Martino. Benedek, with magnificent gallantry,
held his own all day, and in the end covered the retreat of the rest
of the Austrian army to the Mincio. His reward was the commandership
of the order of Maria Theresa, and Vienna and many
other cities followed the example of Lemberg in 1846. His
reputation was now at its highest, and his great popularity was
enhanced, in the prevailing discontent with the reactionary and
clerical government of previous years, by the fact that he was a
Protestant and not of noble birth. He was promoted <i>Feldzeugmeister</i>
and in 1860 appointed quartermaster-general to the army,
and soon afterwards governor-general and commander-in-chief
in Hungary, in succession to the archduke Albert. In 1861 he
was made commander-in-chief in Venetia and the adjoining
provinces of the empire, and in the following year he received
the grand cross of the Leopold order. In 1864 he resigned the
quartermaster-generalship and devoted himself exclusively to
the command of the army in Italy. In 1861 he had been made a
life-member of the house of peers. In 1866 war with Prussia and
with Italy became imminent. Benedek was appointed to command
the Army of the North against the Prussians, the control
of affairs in Italy being taken over by the archduke Albert. For
the story of the campaign of Königgrätz, in which the Austrians
under Benedek&rsquo;s command were decisively defeated, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Seven
Weeks&rsquo; War</a></span>. Benedek took over his new command as a
stranger to the country and to the troops. Only the personal
command of the emperor and the requests of the archduke
Albert prevailed upon him to &ldquo;sacrifice his honour,&rdquo; as he
himself said, in a task for which he felt himself ill prepared.
When he took the field his despondency was increased by the
passive obstruction which he met with amongst his own officers,
many of whom resented being placed under a man of the middle
class instead of the archduke Albert, and by the general state of
unpreparedness which he found existing at the front. Further,
his own staff was self-willed to the verge of disloyalty, and his
assistants, Lieutenant Field Marshal von Henikstein, and Major-General
Krismanic in particular, endeavoured to control Benedek&rsquo;s
operations in the spirit of the 18th-century strategists. Under
these circumstances, and against the superior numbers, <i>moral</i>
and armament of the Prussians, the Austrians were foredoomed
to defeat. A series of partial actions convinced Benedek that
success was unattainable, and he telegraphed to the emperor
advising him to make peace; the emperor refused on the ground
that no decisive battle had been fought; Benedek, thereupon,
instead of retreating across the Elbe, determined to bring on a
decisive engagement, and took up a position with the whole of
his forces near Königgrätz with the Elbe in his rear. Here he was
completely defeated by the Prussians on the 3rd of July, but they
could not prevent him from making good his retreat over the
river in magnificent order on the evening of the battle. He conducted
the operations of his army in retreat up to the great
concentration at Vienna under the archduke Albert, and was
then suspended from his command and a court-martial ordered;
the emperor, however, in December determined that the inquiry
should be stopped. Benedek from this time lived in absolute
retirement, and having given his word of honour to the archduke
Albert that he would not attempt to rehabilitate himself before
the world, he published no defence of his conduct, and even
destroyed his papers relating to the campaign of 1866. This
attitude of self-sacrificing loyalty he maintained even when on
the 8th of November 1866 the official <i>Wiener Zeitung</i> published
an article in which he was made responsible for all the disasters
of the war. The history of the campaign from the Austrian point
of view as at present known leaves much unexplained, and the
published material is primarily of a controversial character. The
official <i>Österreichs Kämpfe</i> speaks of the unfortunate general in
the following terms: &ldquo;A career full of achievements, distinction
and fame deserved a less tragic close. A dispassionate judgment
will not forget the ever fortunate and successful deeds which he
accomplished earlier in the service of the emperor, and will ensure
for him, in spite of his last heavy misfortune (<i>Last</i>), an honourable
memory.&rdquo; Praise of his earlier career could not well be denied,
and the official history is careful not to extend its eulogy to cover
the events of 1866; the recognition in these words cannot
therefore be set against the general opinion of subsequent critics
that Benedek was the victim of political necessities, perhaps of
court intrigues. For the rest of his life Benedek lived at Graz,
where he died on the 27th of April 1881.</p>

marquis de la Valette, who was consul-general at Cairo. He
spent eight years in Egypt, being appointed consul in 1845; in
1848 he was made consul at Palermo, and in 1851 he accompanied
the marquis, who had been appointed ambassador at Constantinople,
as first secretary. For fifteen months during the progress
of the Crimean War he acted as chargé d&rsquo;affaires. In the second
volume of his essays he gives some recollections of his experiences
in the East, including an account of Mehemet Ali, and a (not very
friendly) sketch of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe. In 1855, after
refusing the post of minister at Teheran, he was employed in the
foreign office at Paris, and acted as secretary to the congress at
Paris (1855-1856). During the next few years he was chiefly
occupied with Italian affairs, in which he was much interested,
and Cavour said of him he was an Italian at heart. He was chosen
in 1861 to be the first envoy of France to the king of Italy, but he
resigned his post next year on the retirement of E.A. Thouvenel,
who had been his patron, when the anti-Italian party began to
gain the ascendancy at Paris. In 1864 he was appointed
ambassador at the court of Prussia.</p>

<p>Benedetti remained in Berlin till the outbreak of war in 1870,
and during these years he played an important part in the
diplomatic history of Europe. His position was a difficult one,
for Napoleon did not keep him fully informed as to the course of
French policy. In 1866, during the critical weeks which followed
the attempt of Napoleon to intervene between Prussia and
Austria, he accompanied the Prussian headquarters in the advance
on Vienna, and during a visit to Vienna he helped to arrange the
preliminaries of the armistice signed at Nikolsburg. It was after
this that he was instructed to present to Bismarck French
demands for &ldquo;compensation,&rdquo; and in August, after his return to
Berlin, as a result of his discussions with Bismarck a draft treaty
was drawn up, in which Prussia promised France her support in
the annexation of Belgium. This treaty was never concluded,
but the draft, which was in Benedetti&rsquo;s handwriting, was kept by
Bismarck and, in 1870, a few days after the outbreak of the war,
was published by him in <i>The Times</i>. During 1867 Benedetti was
much occupied with the affair of Luxemburg. In July 1870,
when the candidature of the prince of Hohenzollern for the throne
of Spain became known, Benedetti was instructed by the duc de
Gramont to present to the king of Prussia, who was then at Ems,
the French demands, that the king should order the prince
to withdraw, and afterwards that the king should promise that
the candidature would never be renewed. This last demand
Benedetti submitted to the king in an informal meeting on the
promenade at Ems, and the misleading reports of the conversation
which were circulated were the immediate cause of the war
which followed, for the Germans were led to believe that Benedetti
had insulted the king, and the French that the king had insulted
the ambassador. Benedetti was severely attacked in his own
country for his conduct as ambassador, and the duc de Gramont
attempted to throw upon him the blame for the failures of French
diplomacy. He answered the charges brought against him in a
book, <i>Ma Mission en Prusse</i> (Paris, 1871), which still remains
one of the most valuable authorities for the study of Bismarck&rsquo;s
diplomacy. In this Benedetti successfully defends himself, and
shows that he had kept his government well informed; he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page718" id="page718"></a>718</span>
even warned them a year before as to the proposed Hohenzollern
candidature. Even if he had been outwitted by Bismarck in the
matter of the treaty of 1866, the policy of the treaty was not his,
but was that of E. Drouyn de Lluys. The idea of the annexation
of part of Belgium to France had been suggested to him first by
Bismarck; and the use to which Bismarck put the draft was not
one which he could be expected to anticipate, for he had carried
on the negotiations in good faith. After the fall of the Empire he
retired to Corsica. He lived to see his defence confirmed by later
publications, which threw more light on the secret history of the
times. He published in 1895 a volume of <i>Essais diplomatiques</i>,
containing a full account of his mission to Ems, written in 1873;
and in 1897 a second series dealing with the Eastern question. He
died on the 28th of March 1900, while on a visit to Paris. He
received the title of count from Napoleon.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENEDICT<a name="ar178" id="ar178"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Benedictus</span>), the name taken by fourteen of
the popes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict I.</span> was pope from 573 to 578. He succeeded
John III., and occupied the papal chair during the incursions of
the Lombards, and during the series of plagues and famines which
followed these invasions.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict II.</span> was pope from 684 to 685. He succeeded Leo
II., but although chosen in 683 he was not ordained till 684,
because the leave of the emperor Constantine was not obtained
until some months after the election.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict III.</span> was pope from 855 to 858. He was chosen by
the clergy and people of Rome, but the election was not confirmed
by the emperor, Louis II., who appointed an anti-pope, Anastasius
(the librarian). But the candidature of this person, who had
been deposed from the presbyterate under Leo IV., was indefensible.
The imperial government at length recognized
Benedict and discontinued its opposition, with the result that he
was at last successful. The mythical pope Joan is usually placed
between Benedict and his predecessor, Leo IV.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict IV.</span> was pope from 900 to 903.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict V.</span> was pope from 964 to 965. He was elected by
the Romans on the death of John XII. The emperor Otto I. did
not approve of the choice, and carried off the pope to Hamburg,
where he died.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict VI.</span> was pope from 972 to 974. He was chosen with
great ceremony and installed pope under the protection of the
emperor, Otto the Great. On the death of the emperor the
turbulent citizens of Rome renewed their outrages, and the pope
himself was strangled by order of Crescentius, the son of the
notorious Theodora, who replaced him by a deacon called Franco.
This Franco took the name of Boniface VII.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict VII.</span> was pope from 974 to 983. He was elected
through the intervention of a representative of the emperor, Count
Sicco, who drove out the intruded Franco (afterwards Pope
Boniface VII.). Benedict governed Rome quietly for nearly nine
years, a somewhat rare thing in those days.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict VIII.</span>, pope from 1012 to 1024, was called originally
Theophylactus. He was a member of the family of the count
of Tusculum, and was opposed by an anti-pope, Gregory, but
defeated him with the aid of King Henry II. of Saxony, whom he
crowned emperor in 1014. In his pontificate the Saracens began
to attack the southern coasts of Europe, and effected a settlement
in Sardinia. The Normans also then began to settle in Italy. In
Italy Benedict supported the policy of the emperor, Henry II.,
and at the council of Pavia (1022) exerted himself in favour of
ecclesiastical discipline, then in a state of great decadence.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict IX.</span>, pope from 1033 to 1056, son of Alberic, count
of Tusculum, and nephew of Benedict VIII., was also called
Theophylactus. He was installed pope at the age of twelve
through the influence of his father. The disorders of his conduct,
though tolerated by the emperors, Conrad II. and Henry III.,
who were then morally responsible for the pontificate, at length
disgusted the Romans, who drove him out in 1044 and appointed
Silvester III. his successor. Silvester remained in the papal chair
but a few weeks, as the people of Tusculum quickly recovered
their influence and reinstated their pope. Benedict, however,
was obliged to bow before the execration of the Romans. He sold
his rights to his godfather, the priest Johannes Gratianus, who
was installed under the name of Gregory VI. (1045). The
following year Henry III. obtained at the council of Sutri the
deposition of the three competing popes, and replaced them by
Suidger, bishop of Bamberg, who took the name of Clement II.
But before the close of 1047 Clement II. died, probably from
poison administered by Benedict, who was reinstalled for the
third time. At last, on the 17th of July 1048, the marquis of
Tuscany drove him from Rome, where he was never seen again.
He lived several years after his expulsion and appears to have
died impenitent.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict X.</span> (Johannes &ldquo;Mincius,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the lout or dolt,
bishop of Velletri) was pope from 1058 to 1059. He was elected
on the death of Stephen IX. through the influence of the Roman
barons, who, however, had pledged themselves to take no action
without Hildebrand, who was then absent from Rome. Hildebrand
did not recognize him, and put forward an opposition
pope in the person of Gerard, bishop of Florence (pope as
Nicholas II.), whom he supported against the Roman aristocracy.
With the help of the Normans, Hildebrand seized the castle of
Galeria, where Benedict had taken refuge, and degraded him
to the rank of a simple priest.</p>
<div class="author">(L. D.*)</div>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict XI.</span> (Niccolo Boccasini), pope from 1303 to 1304,
the son of a notary, was born in 1240 at Treviso. Entering the
Dominican order in 1254, he became lector, prior of the convent,
provincial of his order in Lombardy, and in 1296 its general.
In 1298 he was created cardinal priest of Santa Sabina, and in
1300 cardinal bishop of Ostia and Velletri. In 1302 he was
papal legate in Hungary. On the 22nd of October 1303 he was
unanimously elected pope. He did much to conciliate the
enemies made by his predecessor Boniface VIII., notably
France, the Colonnas and King Frederick II. of Sicily; nevertheless
on the 7th of June 1304 he excommunicated William
of Nogaret and all the Italians who had captured Boniface in
Anagni. Benedict died at Perugia on the 7th of July 1304;
if he was really poisoned, as report had it, suspicion would fall
primarily on Nogaret. His successor Clement V. transferred
the papal residence to Avignon. Among Benedict&rsquo;s works
are commentaries on part of the Psalms and on the Gospel of
Matthew. His beatification took place in 1733.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict XII.</span> (Jacques Fournier), pope from 1334 to 1342,
the son of a miller, was born at Saverdun on the Arriège. Entering
the Cistercian cloister Bolbonne, and graduating doctor
of theology at Paris, he became in 1311 abbot of Fontfroide,
in 1317 bishop of Pamiers and in 1326 of Mirepoix. Created
cardinal priest of Santa Prisca in 1327 by his uncle John XXII.
he was elected his successor on the 20th of December 1334.
Benedict made appointments carefully, reformed monastic
orders and consistently opposed nepotism. Unable to remove
his capital to Rome or to Bologna, he began to erect a great
palace at Avignon. In 1336 he decided against a pet notion of
John XXII. by saying that souls of saints may attain the fulness
of the beatific vision <i>before</i> the last judgment. In 1339 he entered
upon fruitless negotiations looking toward the reunion of the
Greek and Roman churches. French influence made futile his
attempt to come to an understanding with the emperor Louis
the Bavarian. He died on the 25th of April 1342.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict XIII.</span> (Pedro de Luna), (<i>c.</i> 1328-1422 or 1423),
anti-pope, belonged to one of the most noble families in Aragon.
His high birth, his legal learning&mdash;he was for a long time professor
of canon law at Montpellier&mdash;and the irreproachable purity
of his life, recommended him to Pope Gregory XI, who created
him cardinal in 1375. He was almost the only one who succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page719" id="page719"></a>719</span>
in making a firm stand in the tumultuous conclave of 1378;
but the deliberation with which he made up his mind as to the
validity of the election of Urban VI. was equalled, when he took
the side of Clement VII., by the ardour and resourcefulness which
he displayed in defending the cause of the pope of Avignon;
it was mainly to him that the latter owed his recognition by
Castile, Aragon and Navarre. When elected pope, or rather
anti-pope, by the cardinals of Avignon, on the 28th of September
1394, it was he who by his astuteness, his resolution, and, it
may be added, by his unswerving faith in the justice of his cause,
was to succeed in prolonging the lamentable schism of the West
for thirty years. The hopes he had aroused that, by a voluntary abdication,
he would restore unity to the church, were vain; though called
upon by the princes of France to carry out his plan, abandoned
by his cardinals, besieged and finally kept
under close observation in the palace of the popes (1398-1403),
he stood firm, and tired out the fury of his opponents. Escaping
from Avignon, he again won obedience in France, and his one
thought was how to triumph over his Italian rival, if necessary,
by force. He yielded, however, to the instances of the
government of Charles VI., and pretending that he wished
to have an interview with Gregory XII., with a view to their
simultaneous abdication, he advanced to Savona, and then to
Porto Venere. The failure of these negotiations, for which he
was only in part responsible, led to the universal movement of
indignation and impatience, which ended, in France, in the
declaration of neutrality (1408), and at Pisa, in the decree of
deposition against the two pontiffs (1409). Benedict XIII.,
who had on his part tried to call together a council at Perpignan,
was by this time recognized hardly anywhere but in his native land, in
Scotland, and in the estates of the countship of Armagnac. He remained
none the less full of energy and of illusions, repulsed the overtures of
Sigismund, king of the Romans, who had come to Perpignan to persuade him
to abdicate, and, abandoned by nearly all his adherents, he took refuge
in the impregnable castle of Peñiscola, on a rock dominating the
Mediterranean (1415). The council of Constance then deposed him, as a
perjurer, an incurable schismatic and a heretic (26th July 1417). After
struggling with the popes of Rome, Urban VI., Boniface IX., Innocent
VII. and Gregory XII., and against the popes of Pisa, Alexander V. and
John XXIII., Pedro de Luna, clinging more than ever to that apostolic
seat which he still professed not to desire, again took up the struggle
against Martin V., although the latter was recognized throughout almost
all Christendom, and, before his death (29th November 1422, or 23rd May
1423), he nominated four new cardinals in order to carry the schism on
even after him.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict XIII.</span> (Piero Francesco Orsini), pope from 1724 to
1730, at first styled Benedict XIV., was born on the 2nd of
February 1649, of the ducal family of Orsini-Gravina. In
1667 he became a Dominican (as Vincentius Maria), studied
theology and philosophy, was made a cardinal in 1672 and archbishop
of Benevento in 1686. Elected pope on the 29th of May
1724, he attempted to reform clerical morals; but neither the
decrees of the Latin council (1725) nor his personal precepts had
much effect. He confirmed the bull <i>Unigenitus</i>; but, despite
the Jesuits, allowed the Dominicans to preach the Augustinian
doctrine of grace. State affairs he left entirely to the unpopular
Cardinal Nicolo Coscia. He died on the 21st of February 1730. His works, were published in 3 vols. at Ravenna in 1728.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Benedict XIV.</span> (Prospero Lorenzo Lambertini), pope from
1740 to 1758, was born at Bologna on the 31st of March 1675.
At the age of thirteen he entered the Collegium Clementinum
at Rome. He served the Curia in many and important capacities,
yet devoted his leisure time to theological and canonistic study.
Benedict XIII. made him archbishop of Theodosia <i>in partibus</i>,
then of Ancona (1727), and the next year created him cardinal
priest. In 1731 Clement XII. translated him to his native city
of Bologna, where as archbishop he was both efficient and popular.
He published valuable works, notably <i>De servorum Dei beatificatione
et canonizatione, De sacrificio missae</i>, as well as a treatise
on the feasts of Christ and the Virgin and of some saints honoured
in Bologna. In a conclave which had lasted for months he was elected
on the 17th of August 1740 the successor of Clement XII.
Benedict XIV. was not merely earnest and conscientious, but of incisive
intellect, and unfailingly cheerful and witty. In several respects he
bettered the economic conditions of the papal states, but was
disinclined to undertake the needed thorough-going reform of its
administration. In foreign politics he made important concessions to
Portugal, Naples, Sardinia, Spain, and was the first pope expressly to
recognize the king of Prussia as such. In 1741 he issued the bull
<i>Immensa pastorum principis</i>, demanding more humane treatment for the
Indians of Brazil and Paraguay, and in the bulls <i>Ex quo singulari</i>
(1742) and <i>Omnium sollicitudinum</i> (1744) he rebuked the missionary
methods of the Jesuits in accommodating their message to the heathen
usages of the Chinese and of the natives of Malabar. In accord with the
spirit of the age he reduced the number of holy days in several Catholic
countries. To the end of his life he kept up his studies and his
intercourse with other scholars, and founded several learned societies.
His masterpiece, <i>Libri octo de synoda diocesana</i>, begun in Bologna,
appeared during his pontificate. He died on the 3rd of May 1758.</p>

twice visited the Holy Land (1239 and 1260), where he helped

<p><span class="bold">BENEDICT OF NURSIA, SAINT<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 480-<i>c.</i> 544), the patriarch of Western
monks. Our only authority for the facts of St Benedict&rsquo;s life is bk. ii
of St Gregory&rsquo;s <i>Dialogues</i>. St Gregory declares that he obtained his
information from four of St Benedict&rsquo;s disciples, whom he names; and
there can be no serious reason for doubting that it is possible to
reconstruct the outlines of St Benedict&rsquo;s career (see Hodgkin, <i>Italy
and her Invaders</i>, iv. 412). A precise chronology and a pedigree have
been supplied for Benedict, according to which he was born in 480, of
the great family of the Anicii; but all we know is what St Gregory tells
us, that he was born of good family in Nursia, near Spoleto in Umbria.
His birth must have occurred within a few years of the date assigned;
the only fixed chronological point is a visit of the Gothic king Totila
to him in 543, when Benedict was already established at Monte Cassino
and advanced in years (<i>Dial</i>. ii. 14, 15). He was sent by his parents
to frequent the Roman schools, but shocked by the prevailing
licentiousness he fled away. It has been usual to represent him as a
mere boy at this time, but of late years various considerations have
been pointed out which make it more likely that he was a young man. He
went to the mountainous districts of the Abruzzi, and at last came to
the ruins of Nero&rsquo;s palace and the artificial lake at Subiaco, 40 m.
from Rome. Among the rocks on the side of the valley opposite the palace
he found a cave in which he took up his abode, unknown to all except one
friend, Romanus, a monk of a neighbouring monastery, who clothed him in
the monastic habit and secretly supplied him with food. No one who has
seen the spot will doubt that the Sacro Speco is indeed the cave wherein
Benedict spent the three years of opening manhood in solitary prayer,
contemplation and austerity. After this period of formation his fame
began to spread abroad, and the monks of a neighbouring monastery
induced him to become their abbot; but their lives were irregular and
dissolute, and on his trying to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page720" id="page720"></a>720</span>
put down abuses they attempted to poison him. He returned
to his cave, but disciples flocked to him, and in time he formed
twelve monasteries in the neighbourhood, placing twelve monks
in each, and himself retaining a general control over all. In time
patricians and senators from Rome entrusted their young sons
to his care, to be brought up as monks; in this manner came to
him his two best-known disciples, Maurus and Placidus. Driven
from Subiaco by the jealousy and molestations of a neighbouring
priest, but leaving behind him communities in his twelve monasteries,
he himself, accompanied by a small band of disciples,
journeyed south until he came to Cassino, a town halfway between
Rome and Naples. Climbing the high mountain that overhangs
the town, he established on the summit the monastery with which
his name has ever since been associated, and which for centuries
was a chief centre of religious life for western Europe. He
destroyed the remnants of paganism that lingered on here, and by
his preaching gained the rustic population to Christianity. Few
other facts of his career are known: there is record of his founding
a monastery at Terracina; his death must have occurred soon
after Totila&rsquo;s visit in 543.</p>

<p><i>Rule of St Benedict.</i>&mdash;In order to understand St Benedict&rsquo;s
character and spirit, and to discover the secret of the success of
his institute, it is necessary, as St Gregory says, to turn to his
Rule. St Gregory&rsquo;s characterization of the Rule as &ldquo;conspicuous
for its discretion&rdquo; touches the most essential quality. The relation
of St Benedict&rsquo;s Rule to earlier monastic rules, and of his
institute to the prevailing monachism of his day, is explained in
the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Monasticism</a></span>. Here it is enough to say that nowadays
it is commonly recognized by students that the manner of life
instituted by St Benedict was not intended to be, and as a matter
of fact was not, one of any great austerity, when judged by the
standard of his own day (see E.C. Butler, <i>Lausiac History of
Palladius</i>, part i. pp. 251-256). His monks were allowed proper
clothes, sufficient food, ample sleep. The only bodily austerities
were the abstinence from flesh meat and the unbroken fast till
mid-day or even 3 <span class="scs">P.M.</span>, but neither would appear so onerous in
Italy even now, as to us in northern climes. Midnight office was
no part of St Benedict&rsquo;s Rule: the time for rising for the night
office varied from 1.30 to 3.0, according to the season, and the
monks had had unbroken sleep for 7½ or even 8 hours, except in
the hot weather, when in compensation they were allowed the
traditional Italian summer siesta after the mid-day meal. The
canonical office was chanted throughout, but the directly religious
duties of the day can hardly have taken more than 4 or 5 hours&mdash;perhaps
8 on Sundays. The remaining hours of the day were
divided between work and reading, in the proportion (on the
average of the whole year) of about 6 and 4 hours respectively.
The &ldquo;reading&rdquo; in St Benedict&rsquo;s time was probably confined to
the Bible and the Fathers. The &ldquo;work&rdquo; contemplated by St
Benedict was ordinarily field work, as was natural in view of
the conditions of the time and best suited to the majority of the
monks; but the principle laid down is that the monks should do
whatever work is most useful. There were from the beginning
young boys in the monastery, who were educated by the monks
according to the ideas of the time. We have seen St Benedict
evangelizing the pagan population round Monte Cassino;
and a considerable time each day is assigned to the reading
of the Fathers. Thus the germs of all the chief works
carried on by his monks in later ages were to be found in his
own monastery.</p>

<p>The Rule consists of a prologue and 73 chapters. Though it has
resisted all attempts to reduce it to an ordered scheme, and
probably was not written on any set plan, still it is possible
roughly to indicate its contents: after the prologue and introductory
chapter setting forth St Benedict&rsquo;s intention, follow
instructions to the abbot on the manner in which he should govern
his monastery (2,3); next comes the ascetical portion of the Rule,
on the chief monastic virtues (4-7); then the regulations for the
celebration of the canonical office, which St Benedict calls &ldquo;the
Work of God&rdquo; or &ldquo;the divine work,&rdquo; his monks&rsquo; first duty, &ldquo;of
which nothing is to take precedence&rdquo; (8-20); faults and punishments
(23-30); the cellarer and property of the monastery
(31, 32); community of goods (33, 34); various officials and daily
life (21, 22, 35-57); reception of monks (58-61); miscellaneous
(62-73).</p>

<p>The most remarkable chapters, in which St Benedict&rsquo;s wisdom
stands out most conspicuously, are those on the abbot (2,3, 27,64).
The abbot is to govern the monastery with full and unquestioned
patriarchal authority; on important matters he must consult
the whole community and hear what each one, even the youngest,
thinks; on matters of less weight he should consult a few of the
elder monks; but in either case the decision rests entirely with
him, and all are to acquiesce. He must, however, bear in mind
that he will have to render an account of all his decisions and to
answer for the souls of all his monks before the judgment seat of
God. Moreover, he has to govern in accordance with the Rule,
and must endeavour, while enforcing discipline and implanting
virtues, not to sadden or &ldquo;overdrive&rdquo; his monks, or give them
cause for &ldquo;just murmuring.&rdquo; In these chapters pre-eminently
appears that element of &ldquo;discretion,&rdquo; as St Gregory calls it, or
humanism as it would now be termed, which without doubt has
been a chief cause of the success of the Rule. There is as yet no
satisfactory text of the Rule, either critical or manual; the best
manual text is Schmidt&rsquo;s <i>editio minor</i> (Regensburg, 1892). Of
the many commentaries the most valuable are those of Paulus
Diaconus (the earliest, <i>c.</i> 800), of Calmet and of Martène (Migne,
<i>Patrol. Lat.</i> lxvi.).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENEDICT, SIR JULIUS<a name="ar181" id="ar181"></a></span> (1804-1885), musical composer, was
born in Stuttgart on the 27th of November 1804. He was the
son of a Jewish banker, and learnt composition from Hummel
at Weimar and Weber at Dresden; with the latter he enjoyed
for three years an intimacy like that of a son, and it was Weber
who introduced him in Vienna to Beethoven on the 5th of October
1823. In the same year he was appointed Kapellmeister of the
Kärnthnerthor theatre at Vienna, and two years later (in 1825)
he became Kapellmeister of the San Carlo theatre at Naples.
Here his first opera, <i>Giacinta ed Ernesto</i>, was brought out in 1829,
and another, written for his native city, <i>I Portoghesi in Goa</i>, was
given there in 1830; neither of these was a great success, and in
1834 he went to Paris, leaving it in 1835 at the suggestion of
Malibran for London, where he spent the remainder of his life.
In 1836 he was given the conductorship of an operatic enterprise
at the Lyceum Theatre, and brought out a short opera, <i>Un anno
ed un giorno</i>, previously given in Naples. In 1838 he became
conductor of the English opera at Drury Lane during the period
of Balfe&rsquo;s great popularity; his own operas produced there were
<i>The Gipsy&rsquo;s Warning</i> (1838), <i>The Bride of Venice</i> (1843), and
<i>The Crusaders</i> (1846). In 1848 he conducted Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
<i>Elijah</i> at Exeter Hall, for the first appearance of Jenny Lind in
oratorio, and in 1850 he went to America as the accompanist on
that singer&rsquo;s tour. On his return in 1852 he became musical
conductor under Mapleson&rsquo;s management at Her Majesty&rsquo;s
theatre (and afterwards at Drury Lane), and in the same year
conductor of the Harmonic Union. Benedict wrote recitatives
for the production of an Italian version of Weber&rsquo;s <i>Oberon</i> in
1860. In the same year was produced his beautiful cantata
<i>Undine</i> at the Norwich festival, in which Clara Novello appeared
in public for the last time. His best-known opera, <i>The Lily of
Killarney</i>, written on the subject of Dion Boucicault&rsquo;s play
<i>Colleen Bawn</i> to a libretto by Oxenford, was produced at Covent
Garden in 1862. His operetta, <i>The Bride of Song</i>, was brought
out there in 1864. <i>St Cecilia</i>, an oratorio, was performed at
the Norwich festival in 1886; <i>St Peter</i> at the Birmingham
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page721" id="page721"></a>721</span>
festival of 1870; <i>Graziella</i>, a cantata, was given at the
Birmingham festival of 1882, and in August 1883 was produced
in operatic form at the Crystal Palace. Here also a symphony
by him was given in 1873. Benedict conducted every Norwich
festival from 1845 to 1878 inclusive, and the Liverpool Philharmonic
Society&rsquo;s concerts from 1876 to 1880. He was the
regular accompanist at the Monday Popular Concerts in London
from their start, and with few exceptions acted as conductor
of these concerts. He contributed an interesting life of Weber
to the series of biographies of &ldquo;Great Musicians.&rdquo; In 1871 he
was knighted, and in 1874 was made knight commander of the
orders of Franz Joseph (Austria) and Frederick (Württemberg).
He died in London on the 5th of June 1885.</p>

Baducing</span>, English churchman, was born of a good Northumbrian
family and was for a time a thegn of King Oswiu. He then went
abroad and after a second journey to Rome (he made five
altogether) lived as a monk at Lerins (665-667). It was under
his conduct that Theodore of Tarsus came from Rome to Canterbury
in 669, and in the same year Benedict was appointed abbot
of St Peter&rsquo;s, Canterbury. Five years later he built the
monastery of St Peter at Wearmouth, on land granted him by
Ecgfrith of Northumbria, and endowed it with an excellent
library. A papal letter in 678 exempted the monastery from
external control, and in 682 Benedict erected a sister foundation
(St Paul) at Jarrow. He died on the 12th of January 690,
leaving a high reputation for piety and culture. Saxon architecture
owes nearly everything to his initiative, and Bede was
one of his pupils.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENEDICTINES,<a name="ar184" id="ar184"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Black Monks</span>, monks living according
to the Rule of St Benedict (<i>q.v.</i>) of Nursia. Subiaco in the
Abruzzi was the cradle of the Benedictines, and in that neighbourhood
St Benedict established twelve monasteries. Afterwards
giving up the direction of these, he migrated to Monte
Cassino and there established the monastery which became the
centre whence his Rule and institute spread. From Monte
Cassino he founded a monastery at Terracina. These fourteen
are the only monasteries of which we have any knowledge as
being founded before St Benedict&rsquo;s death; for the mission of
St Placidus to Sicily must certainly be regarded as mere romance,
nor does there seem to be any solid reason for viewing more
favourably the mission of St Maurus to Gaul. There is some
ground for believing that it was the third abbot of Monte Cassino
who began to spread a knowledge of the Rule beyond the circle
of St Benedict&rsquo;s own foundations. About 580-590 Monte
Cassino was sacked by the Lombards, and the community came
to Rome and was established in a monastery attached to the
Lateran Basilica, in the centre of the ecclesiastical world. It
is now commonly recognized by scholars that when Gregory the
Great became a monk and turned his palace on the Caelian Hill
into a monastery, the monastic life there carried out was fundamentally
based on the Benedictine Rule (see F.H. Dudden,
<i>Gregory the Great</i>, i. 108). From this monastery went forth
St Augustine and his companions on their mission to England in
596, carrying their monachism with them; thus England was
the first country out of Italy in which Benedictine life was
firmly planted. In the course of the 7th century Benedictine
life was gradually introduced in Gaul, and in the 8th it was carried
into the Germanic lands from England. It is doubtful whether
in Spain there were Benedictine monasteries, properly so called,
until a later period. In many parts the Benedictine Rule met
the much stricter Irish Rule of Columbanus, introduced by the
Irish missionaries on the continent, and after brief periods, first
of conflict and then of fusion, it gradually absorbed and supplanted
it; thus during the 8th century it became, out of Ireland
and other purely Celtic lands, the only rule and form of monastic
life throughout western Europe,&mdash;so completely that Charlemagne
once asked if there ever had been any other monastic
rule.</p>

<p>What may be called the inner side of Benedictine life and
history is treated in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Monasticism</a></span>; here it is possible
to deal only with the broad facts of the external history. The
chief external works achieved for western Europe by the Benedictines
during the early middle ages may be summed up under
the following heads.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Conversion of the Teutonic Races.</i>&mdash;The tendency of
modern historical scholarship justifies the maintenance of the
tradition that St Augustine and his forty companions were the
first great Benedictine apostles and missioners. Through their
efforts Christianity was firmly planted in various parts of
England; and after the conversion of the country it was English
Benedictines&mdash;Wilfrid, Willibrord, Swithbert, Willehad&mdash;who
evangelized Friesland and Holland; and another, Winfrid or
Boniface, who, with his fellow-monks Willibald and others,
evangelized the greater part of central Germany and founded and
organized the German church. It was Anschar, a monk of Corbie,
who first preached to the Scandinavians, and other Benedictines
were apostles to Poles, Prussians and other Slavonic peoples.
The conversion of the Teutonic races may properly be called the
work of the Benedictines.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Civilization of north-western Europe.</i>&mdash;As the result of
their missionary enterprises the Benedictines penetrated into all
these lands and established monasteries, so that by the 10th or
11th century Benedictine houses existed in great numbers
throughout the whole of Latin Christendom except Ireland.
These monasteries became centres of civilizing influences by the
method of presenting object-lessons in organized work, in
agriculture, in farming, in the arts and trades, and also in
well-ordered life. The unconscious method by which such great
results were brought about has been well described by J.S. Brewer
(<i>Preface</i> to Works of Giraldus Cambrensis, Rolls Series, iv.) and
F.A. Gasquet.</p>

<p>3. <i>Education.</i>&mdash;Boys were educated in Benedictine houses from
the beginning, but at first they were destined to be monks. The
monasteries, however, played a great part in the educational side
of the Carolingian revival; and certainly from that date schools
for boys destined to live and work in the world were commonly
attached to Benedictine monasteries. From that day to this
education has been among the recognized and principal works of
Benedictines.</p>

<p>4. <i>Letters and Learning.</i>&mdash;This side of Benedictine life is most
typically represented by the Venerable Bede, the gentle and
learned scholar of the early middle ages. In those times the
monasteries were the only places of security and rest in western
Europe, the only places where letters could in any measure be
cultivated. It was in the monasteries that the writings of Latin
antiquity, both classical and ecclesiastical, were transcribed and
preserved.</p>

<p>In a gigantic system embracing hundreds of monasteries and
thousands of monks, and spread over all the countries of western
Europe, without any organic bond between the different houses,
and exposed to all the vicissitudes of the wars and conquests of
those wild times, to say that the monks often fell short of the ideal
of their state, and sometimes short of the Christian, and even the
moral standard, is but to say that monks are men. Failures there
have been many, and scandals not a few in Benedictine history;
but it may be said with truth that there does not appear to have
been ever a period of widespread or universal corruption, however
much at times and in places primitive love may have waxed cold.
And when such declensions occurred, they soon called forth efforts
at reform and revival; indeed these constantly recurring reform-movements
are one of the most striking features of Benedictine
history, and the great proof of the vitality of the institute throughout
the ages.</p>

<p>The first of these movements arose during the Carolingian
revival (<i>c.</i> 800), and is associated with the name of Benedict of
Aniane. Under the auspices of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious
he initiated a scheme for federating into one great order, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page722" id="page722"></a>722</span>
himself as abbot general, all the monasteries of Charles&rsquo;s empire,
and for enforcing throughout a rigid uniformity in observance.
For this purpose a synod of abbots was assembled at Aix-la-Chapelle
in 817, and a series of 80 <i>Capitula</i> passed, regulating the
life of the monasteries. The scheme as a whole was short-lived
and did not survive its originator; but the <i>Capitula</i> were commonly
recognized as supplying a useful and much-needed supplement
to St Benedict&rsquo;s Rule on points not sufficiently provided
for therein. Accordingly these <i>Capitula</i> exercised a wide influence
among Benedictines even outside the empire. And Benedict of
Aniane&rsquo;s ideas of organization found embodiment a century later
in the order of Cluny (910), which for a time overshadowed the
great body of mere Benedictines (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cluny</a></span>). Here it will suffice
to say that the most distinctive features of the Cluny system were
(1) a notable increase and prolongation of the church services,
which came to take up the greater part of the working day; (2)
a strongly centralized government, whereby the houses of the
order in their hundreds were strictly subject to the abbot of Cluny.</p>

<p>Though forming a distinct and separate organism Cluny claimed
to be, and was recognized as, a body of Benedictine houses; but
from that time onwards arose a number of independent bodies, or
&ldquo;orders,&rdquo; which took the Benedictine Rule as the basis of their
life. The more important of these were: in the 11th and 12th centuries,
the orders of Camaldulians, Vallombrosians, Fontevrault
and the Cistercians, and in the 13th and 14th the Silvestrines,
Celestines and Olivetans (see separate articles). The general
tendency of these Benedictine offshoots was in the direction of
greater austerity of life than was practised by the Black Monks
or contemplated by St Benedict&rsquo;s Rule&mdash;some of them were
semi-eremitical; the most important by far were the Cistercians,
whose ground-idea was to reproduce exactly the life of St
Benedict&rsquo;s own monastery. These various orders were also
organized and governed according to the system of centralized
authority devised by St Pachomius (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Monasticism</a></span>) and
brought into vogue by Cluny in the West. What has here to be
traced is the history of the great body of Benedictine monasteries
that held aloof from these separatist movements.</p>

<p>For the first four or five centuries of Benedictine history there
was no organic bond between any of the monasteries; each house
formed an independent autonomous family, managing its own
affairs and subject to no external authority or control except that
of the bishop of the diocese. But the influence of Cluny, even on
monasteries that did not enter into its organism, was enormous;
many adopted Cluny customs and practices and moulded their
life and spirit after the model it set; and many such monasteries
became in turn centres of revival and reform in many lands, so
that during the 10th and 11th centuries arose free unions of
monasteries based on a common observance derived from a
central abbey. Fleury and Hirsau are well-known examples.
Basing themselves on St Gregory&rsquo;s counsel to St Augustine,
Dunstan, Aethelwold and Oswald adopted from the observance
of foreign monasteries, and notably Fleury and Ghent, what was
suitable for the restoration of English monachism, and so produced
the <i>Concordia Regularis</i>, interesting as the first serious attempt to
bring about uniformity of observance among the monasteries of
an entire nation. In the course of the 12th century sporadic and
limited unions of Black Monk monasteries arose in different parts.
But notwithstanding all these movements, the majority of the
great Black Monk abbeys continued to the end of the 12th century
in their primeval isolation. But in the year 1215, at the fourth
Lateran council, were made regulations destined profoundly to
modify Benedictine polity and history. It was decreed that the
Benedictine houses of each ecclesiastical province should henceforth
be federated for the purposes of mutual help and the
maintenance of discipline, and that for these ends the abbots
should every third year meet in a provincial chapter (or synod),
in order to pass laws binding on all and to appoint visitors who,
in addition to the bishops, should canonically visit the monasteries
and report on their condition in spirituals and temporals to the
ensuing chapter. The English monks took the lead in carrying
out this legislation, and in 1218 the first chapter of the province of
Canterbury was held at Oxford, and up to the dissolution under
Henry VIII. the triennial chapters took place with wonderful
regularity. Fitful attempts were made elsewhere to carry out the
decrees, and in 1336 Benedict XII. by the bull <i>Benedictina</i> tried
to give further development to the system and to secure its
general observance. The organization of the Benedictine houses
into provinces or chapters under this legislation interfered in the
least possible degree with the Benedictine tradition of mutual
independence of the houses; the provinces were loose federations
of autonomous houses, the legislative power of the chapter and
the canonical visitations being the only forms of external interference.
The English Benedictines never advanced farther along
the path of centralization; up to their destruction this polity
remained in operation among them, and proved itself by its
results to be well adapted to the conditions of the Benedictine
Rule and life.</p>

<p>In other lands things did not on the whole go so well, and
many causes at work during the later middle ages tended
to bring about relaxation in the Benedictine houses; above all
the vicious system of commendatory abbots, rife everywhere
except in England. And so in the period of the reforming
councils of Constance and Basel the state of the religious orders
was seriously taken in hand, and in response to the public demand
for reforming the Church, &ldquo;in head and members,&rdquo; reform
movements were set on foot, as among others, so among the
Benedictines of various parts of Europe. These movements
issued in the congregational system which is the present polity
among Benedictines. In the German lands, where the most
typical congregation was the Bursfeld Union (1446), which
finally embraced over 100 monasteries throughout Germany,
the system was kept on the lines of the Lateran decree and
the bull <i>Benedictina</i>, and received only some further developments
in the direction of greater organization; but in Italy
the congregation of S. Justina at Padua (1421), afterwards
called the Cassinese, departed altogether from the old lines,
setting up a highly centralized government, after the model
of the Italian republics, whereby the autonomy of the monasteries
was destroyed, and they were subjected to the authority
of a central governing board. With various modifications or
restrictions this latter system was imported into all the Latin
lands, into Spain and Portugal, and thence into Brazil, and
into Lorraine and France, where the celebrated congregation
of St Maur (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Maurists</a></span>) was formed early in the 17th century.
During this century the Benedictine houses in many parts of
Catholic Europe united themselves into congregations, usually
characterized by an austerity that was due to the Tridentine
reform movement.</p>

<p>In England the Benedictines had, from every point of view,
flourished exceedingly. At the time of the Dissolution there
were nearly 300 Black Benedictine houses, great and small,
men and women, including most of the chief religious houses
of the land (for lists see tables and maps in Gasquet&rsquo;s <i>English
Monastic Life</i>, and <i>Catholic Dictionary</i>, art. &ldquo;Benedictines&rdquo;).
It is now hardly necessary to say that the grave charges brought
against the monks are no longer credited by serious historians
(Gasquet, <i>Henry VIII. and the Monasteries</i>; J. Gairdner,
Prefaces to the relevant volumes of <i>Calendars of State Papers
of Henry VIII.</i>). In Mary&rsquo;s reign some of the surviving monks
were brought together, and Westminster Abbey was restored.
Of the monks professed there during this momentary revival,
one, Sigebert Buckley, lived on into the reign of James I.; and
being the only survivor of the Benedictines of England, he
in 1607 invested with the English habit and affiliated to Westminster
Abbey and to the English congregation two English
priests, already Benedictines in the Italian congregation. By
this act the old English Benedictine line was perpetuated;
and in 1619 a number of English monks professed in Spain were
aggregated by pontifical act to these representatives of the old
English Benedictines, and thus was constituted the present
English Benedictine congregation. Three or four monasteries
of the revived English Benedictines were established on the
continent at the beginning of the 17th century, and remained
there till driven back to England by the French Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page723" id="page723"></a>723</span></p>

<p>The Reformation and the religious wars spread havoc among
the Benedictines in many parts of northern Europe; and as
a consequence, in part of the rule of Joseph II. of Austria,
in part of the French Revolution, nearly every Benedictine
monastery in Europe was suppressed&mdash;it is said that in the
early years of the 19th century scarcely thirty in all survived.
But the latter half of the century witnessed a series of remarkable
revivals, and first in Bavaria, under the influence of Louis I.
The French congregation (which does not enjoy continuity with
the Maurists) was inaugurated by Dom Guéranger in 1833, and
the German congregation of Beuron in 1863. Two vigorous
congregations have arisen in the United States. These are
all new creations since 1830. In Italy, Spain, Portugal and
Brazil only a few monasteries survive the various revolutions,
and in a crippled state; but signs are not wanting of renewed
life: St Benedict&rsquo;s own monasteries of Subiaco and Monte
Cassino are relatively flourishing. In Austria, Hungary and
Switzerland there are some thirty great abbeys, most of which
have had a continued existence since the middle ages. The
English congregation is composed of three large abbeys (Downside,
Ampleforth and Woolhampton), a cathedral priory (Hereford)
and a nunnery (Stanbrook Abbey, Worcester); there
are besides in England three or four abbeys belonging to foreign
congregations, and several nunneries subject to the bishops.
Each congregation has its president, who is merely a president,
with limited powers, and not a general superior like the
Provincials of other orders; so that the primitive Benedictine
principle of each monastery being self-contained and autonomous
is preserved. Similarly each congregation is independent
and self-governing, there being no superior-general or central
authority, as in other orders. Leo XIII. established an international
Benedictine College in Rome for theological studies,
and conferred on its abbot the title of &ldquo;Abbot Primate,&rdquo; with
precedence among Black Monk abbots. He is only <i>primus
inter pares</i>, and exercises no kind of superiority over the
other abbots or congregations. Thus the Benedictine polity
may be described as a number of autonomous federations
of autonomous monasteries. The individual monks, too, belong
not to the order or the congregation, but each to the monastery
in which he became a monk. The chief external work of the
Benedictines at the present day is secondary education; there
are 114 secondary schools or <i>gymnasia</i> attached to the abbeys,
wherein the monks teach over 12,000 boys; and many of
the nunneries have girls&rsquo; schools. In certain countries (among
them England) where there is a dearth of secular priests, Benedictines
undertake parochial work.</p>

<p>The statistics of the order (1905) show that of Black Benedictines
there are over 4000 choir-monks and nearly 2000
lay brothers&mdash;figures that have more than doubled since 1880.
If the Cistercians and lesser offshoots of the order be added,
the sum total of choir-monks and lay brothers exceeds 11,000.</p>

<p>In conclusion a word must be said on the Benedictine nuns.
From the beginning the number of women living the Benedictine
life has not fallen far short of that of the men. St Gregory
describes St Benedict&rsquo;s sister Scholastica as a nun (<i>sanctimonialis</i>),
and she is looked upon as the foundress of Benedictine nuns.
As the institute spread to other lands nunneries arose on all
sides, and nowhere were the Benedictine nuns more numerous
or more remarkable than in England, from Saxon times to the
Reformation. A strong type of womanhood is revealed in the
correspondence of St Boniface with various Saxon Benedictine
nuns, some in England and some who accompanied him to the
continent and there established great convents. In the early
times the Benedictine nuns were not strictly enclosed, and
could, when occasion called for it, freely go out of their convent
walls to perform any special work: on the other hand, they did
not resemble the modern active congregations of women,
whose ordinary work lies outside the convent. It has to
be said that in the course of the middle ages, especially the
later middle ages, grave disorders arose in many convents;
and this doubtless led, in the reform movements initiated by
the councils of Constance and Basel, and later of Trent, to the
introduction of strict enclosure in Benedictine convents, which
now is the almost universal practice. At the present day
there are of Black Benedictine nuns 262 convents with 7000
nuns, the large majority being directly subject to the diocesan
bishops; if the Cistercians and others be included, there are
387 convents with nearly 11,000 nuns. In England there are
a dozen Benedictine nunneries.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>&mdash;The chief general authority for Benedictine
history up to the middle of the 12th century is Mabillon&rsquo;s <i>Annales</i>,
in 6 vols. folio; for the later period no such general work exists, but
the various countries, congregations or even abbeys have to be taken
separately. Montalembert&rsquo;s <i>Monks of the West</i> gives the early
history very fully; the later history, to the beginning of the 18th
century, may be found in Helyot, <i>Hist. des ordres religieux</i>, v. and
vi. (1792). A useful sketch, with references to the best literature,
is in Max Heimbucher, <i>Orden und Kongregationen</i> (1896), i. §§ 17-28;

<p><span class="bold">BENEDICTION<a name="ar185" id="ar185"></a></span> (Lat. <i>benedictio</i>, from <i>benedicere</i>, to bless),
generally, the utterance of a blessing or of a devout wish for the
prosperity and happiness of a person or enterprise. In the usage
of the Catholic Church, both East and West, though the benediction
as defined above has its place as between one Christian
and another, it has also a special place in the sacramental system
in virtue of the special powers of blessing vested in the priesthood.
Sacerdotal benedictions are not indeed sacraments&mdash;means of
grace ordained by Christ himself,&mdash;but sacramentals (<i>sacramenta
minora</i>) ordained by the authority of the Church and
exercised by the priests, as the plenipotentiaries of God, in virtue
of the powers conferred on them at their ordination; &ldquo;that
whatever they bless may be blessed, and whatever they consecrate
may be consecrated.&rdquo; The power to bless in this
ecclesiastical sense is reserved to priests alone; the blessing of
the paschal candle on Holy Saturday by the deacon being the
one exception that proves the rule, for he uses for the purpose
grains of incense previously blessed by the priest at the altar.
But though by some the benediction has thus been brought into
connexion with the supreme means of grace, the sacrifice of the
Mass, the blessing does not in itself confer grace and does not act
on its recipients <i>ex opere operato</i>. It must not be supposed,
however, that the Catholic idea of a sacerdotal blessing has anything
of the vague character associated with a benediction by
Protestants. Both by Catholics and by Protestants blessings may
be applied to things inanimate as well as animate; but while
in the reformed Churches this involves no more than an appeal
to God for a special blessing, or a solemn &ldquo;setting apart&rdquo; of
persons or objects for sacred purposes, in the Catholic idea it
implies a special power, conferred by God, of the priests over
the invisible forces of evil. It thus stands in the closest relation
to the rite of exorcism, of which it is the complement.</p>

<p>According to Catholic doctrine, the Fall involved the subjection,
not only of man, but of all things animate and inanimate,
to the influence of evil spirits; in support of which St Paul&rsquo;s
epistles to the Romans (viii.) and to Timothy (1 Tim. iv. 4-5)
are quoted. This belief is, of course, not specifically Christian;
it has been held at all times and everywhere by men of the most
various races and creeds; and, if there be any validity in the
contention that that is true which has been held <i>semper, ubique,
et ab omnibus</i>, no fact is better established. In general it may
be said, then, that whereas exorcism is practised in order to
cast out devils already in possession, benediction is the formula
by which they are prevented from entering in. Protestants
have condemned these formulae as so much magic, and in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page724" id="page724"></a>724</span>
modern science tends to agree with them; but to orthodox
Protestants at least Catholics have a perfect right to reply that,
in taking this line, they are but repeating the accusation brought
by the Pharisees against Christ, viz. that he cast out devils
&ldquo;by Beelzebub, prince of the devils.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though, however, the discomfiture of malignant spirits still
plays an important part in the Catholic doctrine of benedictions,
this has on the whole tended to become subordinated to other
benefits. This is but natural; for, though the progress of
knowledge has not disproved the existence of devils, it has
greatly limited the supposed range of their activities. According
to Father Patrick Morrisroe, dean and professor of liturgy at
Maynooth, the efficacy of benedictions is fourfold: (1) the
excitation of pious emotions and affections of the heart, and by
their means the remission of venial sins and of the temporal punishments
due for these; (2) freedom from the power of evil spirits;
(3) preservation and restoration of bodily health; (4) various
other benefits, temporal and spiritual. Benedictions, moreover,
are twofold: (<i>a</i>) invocative, <i>i.e.</i> those invoking the divine
benignity for persons and things without changing their condition,
<i>e.g.</i> children or food; (<i>b</i>) constitutive, <i>i.e.</i> those which
give to persons or things an indelible religious character, <i>i.e.</i>
monks and nuns, or the furniture of the altar. The second of
these brings the act of benediction into contact with the principle
of consecration (<i>q.v.</i>); for by the formal blessing by the duly
constituted authority persons, places and things are consecrated,
<i>i.e.</i> reserved to sacred uses and preserved from the contaminating
influence of evil spirits. Thus graveyards are consecrated, <i>i.e.</i>
solemnly blessed in order that the powers of evil may not disturb
the bodies of the faithful departed; thus, too, the blessing of
bells gives them a special power against evil demons.</p>

<p>Though the giving of blessings as a sacerdotal function is
proper to the whole order of priests, particular benedictions
have, by ecclesiastical authority, been reserved for the bishops,
who may, however, delegate some of them; <i>i.e.</i> the benediction
of abbots, of priests at their ordination, of virgins taking the veil,
of churches, cemeteries, oratories, and of all articles for use in
connexion with the altar (chalices, patens, vestments, &amp;c.), of
military colours, of soldiers and of their arms. The holy oil is
also blessed by bishops in the Roman Catholic Church; in the
Greek Church, on the other hand, the oil for the chrism at baptism
is blessed by the priest. To the pope alone is reserved the blessing
of the pallium, the golden rose, the &ldquo;Agnus-Dei&rdquo; and royal swords;
he alone, too, can issue blessings that involve some days&rsquo;
indulgence. The ceremonies prescribed for the various benedictions
are set forth in the <i>Rituale Romanum</i> (tit. viii.). In general it
is laid down (cap. i.) that the priest, in benedictions outside the
Mass, shall be vested in surplice and stole, and shall give the
blessing standing and bare-headed. Certain prayers are said
before each benediction, after which he sprinkles the person or
thing to be blessed with holy water and, where prescribed, censes
them. He is attended by a minister with a vase of holy water,
an <i>aspergillum</i> and a copy of the <i>Rituale</i> or missal. In all
benedictions the sign of the cross is made. In the blessing of the holy
water (cap. ii.), the essential instrument of all benedictions, the
object is dearly to establish its potency against evil spirits.
First the &ldquo;creature of salt&rdquo; is exorcized, &ldquo;that ... thou
mayest be to all who take thee health of body and soul; that
wherever thou art sprinkled every phantasy and wickedness and
wile of diabolic deceit may flee and leave that place, and every
unclean spirit&rdquo;; a prayer to God for the blessing of the salt
follows; then the &ldquo;creature of water&rdquo; is exorcized, &ldquo;that thou
mayest become exorcized water for the purpose of putting to
flight every power of the enemy, that thou mayest avail to uproot
and expel this enemy with all his apostate angels, by the virtue
of the same our Lord Jesus Christ, &amp;c.&rdquo;; and again a prayer
to God follows that the water may &ldquo;become a creature in the
service of His mysteries, for the driving out of demons, &amp;c.&rdquo;
In the formulae of blessings that follow, the special efficacy
against devils is implied by the aspersion with holy water; the
benedictions themselves are usually merely invocative of the
divine protection or assistance, though, <i>e.g.</i>, in the form for
blessing sick animals the priest prays that &ldquo;all diabolic power in
them may be destroyed, and that they may be ill no longer.&rdquo; It
is to be remarked that the &ldquo;laying on of hands,&rdquo; which in the Old
and the New Testament alike is the usual &ldquo;form&rdquo; of blessing, is not
used in liturgical benedictions, the priest being directed merely
to extend his right hand towards the person to be blessed. The
appendix <i>de Benedictionibus</i> to the <i>Rituale Romanum</i> contains
formulae, often of much simple beauty, for blessing all manner of
persons and things, from the congregation as a whole and sick
men and women, to railways, ships, blast-furnaces, lime-kilns,
articles of food, medicine and medical bandages and all manner
of domestic animals.</p>

<p>The <i>Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament</i>, commonly called
simply &ldquo;Benediction&rdquo; (Fr. <i>salut</i>, Ger. <i>Segen</i>), is one of the
most popular of the services of the Roman Catholic Church. It
is usually held in the afternoon or evening, sometimes at the
conclusion of Vespers, Compline or the Stations of the Cross,
and consists in the singing of certain hymns and canticles, more
particularly the <i>O salutaris hostia</i> and the <i>Tantum ergo</i>,
before the host, which is exposed on the altar in a monstrance and
surrounded by not less than ten lighted candles. Often litanies
and hymns to the Virgin are added. At the conclusion the priest,
his shoulders wrapped in the humeral veil, takes the monstrance
and with it makes the sign of the cross over the kneeling
congregation, whence the name Benediction. The service, the details
of which vary in different countries, is of comparatively modern
origin. Father Thurston traces it to a combination in the 16th
and 17th centuries of customs that had their origin in the 13th,
<i>i.e.</i> certain gild services in honour of the Blessed Virgin, and
the growing habit, resulting naturally from the doctrine of
transubstantiation, of ascribing a supreme virtue to the act of
looking on the Holy Sacrament.</p>

<p>In the reformed Churches the word &ldquo;benediction&rdquo; is technically
confined to the blessing with which the priest or minister
dismisses the congregation at the close of the service.</p>

called from the opening word of the Latin version. The hymn
has been used in Christian worship since at least the 9th century,
and was adopted into the Anglican Order of Morning Prayer from
the Roman service of matin-lauds. In the Prayer-Book of 1549
there was no alternative to the <i>Benedictus</i>; it was to be used
&ldquo;throughout the whole year.&rdquo; In 1552 the <i>Jubilate</i> was inserted
without any restriction as to how often it should take the place of
the <i>Benedictus</i>. Such restriction is clearly implied in the words
&ldquo;except when that (Benedictus) shall happen to be read in the
chapter for the day, or for the Gospel on Saint John Baptist&rsquo;s
day,&rdquo; which were inserted in 1662. The rubric of 1532 had this

<p><span class="bold">BENEDICTUS ABBAS<a name="ar187" id="ar187"></a></span> (d. 1194), abbot of Peterborough, whose
name is accidentally connected with the <i>Gesta Henrici Regis
Secundi</i>, one of the most valuable of English 12th-century
chronicles. He first makes his appearance in 1174, as the
chancellor of Archbishop Richard, the successor of Becket in
the primacy. In 1175 Benedictus became prior of Holy Trinity,
Canterbury; in 1177 he received from Henry II. the abbacy of
Peterborough, which he held until his death. As abbot he
distinguished himself by his activity in building, in administering
the finances of his house and in collecting a library. He is
described in the <i>Chronicon Petroburgense</i> as &ldquo;blessed both in name
and deed.&rdquo; He belonged to the circle of Becket&rsquo;s admirers, and
wrote two works dealing with the martyrdom and the miracles of
his hero. Fragments of the former work have come down to us
in the compilation known as the <i>Quadrilogus</i>, which is printed in
the fourth volume of J.C. Robertson&rsquo;s <i>Materials for the History of Thomas Becket</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page725" id="page725"></a>725</span>
(Rolls series); the miracles are extant in their
entirety, and are printed in the second volume of the same
collection. Benedictus has been credited with the authorship
of the <i>Gesta Henrici</i> on the ground that his name appears in the
title of the oldest manuscript. We have, however, conclusive
evidence that Benedictus merely caused this work to be transcribed
for the Peterborough library. It is only through the force
of custom that the work is still occasionally cited under the name
of Benedictus. The question of authorship has been discussed
by Sir T.D. Hardy, Bishop Stubbs and Professor Liebermann;
but the results of the discussion are negative. Stubbs conjecturally
identified the first part of the <i>Gesta</i> (1170-1177) with the
<i>Liber Tricolumnis</i>, a register of contemporary events kept by
Richard Fitz Neal (<i>q.v.</i>), the treasurer of Henry II. and author of
the <i>Dialogus de Scaccario</i>; the latter part (1177-1192) was by
the same authority ascribed to Roger of Hoveden, who makes
large use of the <i>Gesta</i> in his own chronicle, copying them with
few alterations beyond the addition of some documents. This
theory, so far as concerns the <i>Liber Tricolumnis</i>, is rejected by
Liebermann and the most recent editors of the <i>Dialogus</i>
(A. Hughes, C.G. Crump and C. Johnson, Oxford, 1902). We can
only say that the <i>Gesta</i> are the work of a well-informed
contemporary who appears to have been closely connected with the
court and is inclined on all occasions to take the side of Henry II.
The author confines himself to the external history of events, and
his tone is strictly impersonal. He incorporates some official
documents, and in many places obviously derives his information
from others which he does not quote. There is a break in his work
at the year 1177, where the earliest manuscript ends; but the
reasons which have been given to prove that the authorship
changes at this point are inconclusive. The work begins at
Christmas 1169, and concludes in 1192; it is thus in form a
fragment, covering portions of the reign of Henry II. and Richard I.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENEDIX, JULIUS RODERICH<a name="ar188" id="ar188"></a></span> (1811-1873), German
dramatist and librettist, was born at Leipzig on the 21st of

He joined the stage in 1831, his first engagement being with the
travelling company of H.E. Bethmann in Dessau, Cöthen,
Bernburg and Meiningen. Subsequently he was tenor in several
theatres in Westphalia and on the Rhine, and became manager
of the theatre at Wesel, where he produced a comedy, <i>Das
bemooste Haupt</i> (1841), which met with great success. After an
engagement in Cologne, he managed the new theatre at Elberfeld
(1844-1845) and in 1849 was appointed teacher on the staff of
the Rhenish school of music in Cologne. In 1855 he was
appointed intendant of the municipal theatre in Frankfort-On-Main,
but retired in 1861, and died in Leipzig on the 26th of
September 1873. Benedix&rsquo;s comedies, the scenes of which are
mostly laid in upper middle-class life, still enjoy some popularity;

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BENEFICE<a name="ar189" id="ar189"></a></span> (Lat. <i>beneficium</i>, benefit), a term first applied
under the Roman empire to portions of land, the usufruct of
which was granted by the emperors to their soldiers or others
for life, as a reward or <i>beneficium</i> for past services, and as a
retainer for future services. A list of all such <i>beneficia</i> was
recorded in the <i>Book of Benefices</i> (<i>Liber Beneficiorum</i>), which was
kept by the principal registrar of benefices (<i>Primiscrinius Beneficiorum</i>).
In imitation of the practice observed under the Roman
empire, the term came to be applied under the feudal system
to portions of land granted by a lord to his vassal for the
maintenance of the latter on condition of his rendering military
service; and such grants were originally for life only, and the
land reverted to the lord on the death of the vassal. In a
similar manner grants of land, or of the profits of land, appear
to have been made by the bishops to their clergy for life, on the
ground of some extraordinary merit on the part of the grantee.
The validity of such grants was first formally recognized by the
council of Orleans, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 511, which forbade, however, under any
circumstances, the alienation from the bishoprics of any lands so
granted. The next following council of Orleans, 533, broke in
upon this principle, by declaring that a bishop could not reclaim
from his clergy any grants made to them by his predecessor,
excepting in cases of misconduct. This innovation on the ancient
practice was confirmed by the subsequent council of Lyons, 566,
and from this period these grants ceased to be regarded as
personal, and their substance became annexed to the churches,&mdash;in
other words, they were henceforth enjoyed <i>jure tituli</i>, and no
longer <i>jure personali</i>. How and when the term <i>beneficia</i> came
to be applied to these episcopal grants is uncertain, but they are
designated by that term in a canon of the council of Mainz, 813.</p>

<p>The term benefice, according to the canon law, implies always
an ecclesiastical office, <i>propter quod beneficium datur</i>, but it does
not always imply a cure of souls. It has been defined to be the
right which a clerk has to enjoy certain ecclesiastical revenues
on condition of discharging certain services prescribed by the
canons, or by usage, or by the conditions under which his office
has been founded. These services might be those of a secular
priest with cure of souls, or they might be those of a regular
priest, a member of a religious order, without cure of souls;
but in every case a benefice implied three things: (1) An
obligation to discharge the duties of an office, which is altogether
spiritual; (2) The right to enjoy the fruits attached to that
office, which is the benefice itself; (3) The fruits themselves,
which are the temporalities. By keeping these distinctions in
view, the right of patronage in the case of secular benefices
becomes intelligible, being in fact the right, which was originally
vested in the donor of the temporalities, to present to the bishop
a clerk to be admitted, if found fit by the bishop, to the office to
which those temporalities are annexed. Nomination or presentation
on the part of the patron of the benefice is thus the first
requisite in order that a clerk should become legally entitled
to a benefice. The next requisite is that he should be admitted
by the bishop as a fit person for the spiritual office to which the
benefice is annexed, and the bishop is the judge of the sufficiency
of the clerk to be so admitted. By the early constitutions of the
Church of England a bishop was allowed a space of two months
to inquire and inform himself of the sufficiency of every presentee,
but by the ninety-fifth of the canons of 1604 that interval
has been abridged to twenty-eight days, within which the bishop
must admit or reject the clerk. If the bishop rejects the clerk
within that time he is liable to a <i>duplex querela</i> in the
ecclesiastical courts, or to a <i>quare impedit</i> in the common
law courts, and the bishop must then certify the reasons of his refusal.
In cases where the patron is himself a clerk in orders, and wishes
to be admitted to the benefice, he must proceed by way of petition
instead of by deed of presentation, reciting that the benefice is
in his own patronage, and petitioning the bishop to examine
him and admit him. Upon the bishop having satisfied himself
of the sufficiency of the clerk, he proceeds to institute him to the
spiritual office to which the benefice is annexed, but, before such
institution can take place, the clerk is required to make a declaration
of assent to the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion and to the
Book of Common Prayer according to a form prescribed in the
Clerical Subscription Act 1865, to make a declaration against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page726" id="page726"></a>726</span>
simony in accordance with that act, and to take and subscribe
the oath of allegiance according to the form in the Promissory
Oaths Act 1868. The bishop, by the act of institution, commits
to the clerk the cure of souls attached to the office to which the
benefice is annexed. In cases where the bishop himself is patron
of the benefice, no presentation or petition is required to be
tendered by the clerk, but the bishop having satisfied himself
of the sufficiency of the clerk, collates him to the benefice and
office. It is not necessary that the bishop himself should personally
institute or collate a clerk; he may issue a fiat to his vicar-general,
or to a special commissary for that purpose. After the
bishop or his commissary has instituted the presentee, he issues
a mandate under seal, addressed to the archdeacon or some
other neighbouring clergyman, authorizing him to induct the
clerk into his benefice,&mdash;in other words, to put him into legal
possession of the temporalities, which is done by some outward
form, and for the most part by delivery of the bell-rope to
the clerk, who thereupon tolls the bell. This form of induction
is required to give the clerk a legal title to his <i>beneficium</i>,
although his admission to the office by institution is sufficient
to vacate any other benefice which he may already possess.</p>

<p>By a decree of the Lateran council of 1215, which was enforced
in England, no clerk can hold two benefices with cure of
souls, and if a beneficed clerk shall take a second benefice with
cure of souls, he vacates <i>ipso facto</i> his first benefice. Dispensations,
however, could be easily obtained from Rome, before the
reformation of the Church of England, to enable a clerk to hold
several ecclesiastical dignities or benefices at the same time, and
by the Peterpence, Dispensations, &amp;c. Act 1534, the power to
grant such dispensations, which had been exercised previously
by the court of Rome, was transferred to the archbishop of
Canterbury, certain ecclesiastical persons having been declared
by a previous statute (1529) to be entitled to such dispensations.
The system of pluralities carried with it, as a necessary consequence,
systematic non-residence on the part of many incumbents,
and delegation of their spiritual duties in respect of their
cures of souls to assistant curates. The evils attendant on this
system were found to be so great that the Pluralities Act 1838
was passed to abridge the holding of benefices in plurality,
and it was enacted that no person should hold under any
circumstances more than two benefices, and this privilege
was made subject to the restriction that his benefices were
within ten statute miles of each other. By the Pluralities Act
1850, the restriction was further narrowed, so that no spiritual
person could hold two benefices except the churches of such
benefices were within three miles of each other by the nearest
road, and the annual value of one of such benefices did not exceed
£100. By this statute the term benefice is defined to
mean benefice with cure of souls and no other, and therein to
comprehend all parishes, perpetual curacies, donatives, endowed
public chapels, parochial chapelries and chapelries or districts
belonging or reputed to belong, or annexed or reputed to be
annexed, to any church or chapel. The Pluralities Acts Amendment
Act 1885, however, enacted that, by dispensation from the
archbishop, two benefices could be held together, the churches
of which are within four miles of each other, and the annual value
of one of which does not exceed £200.</p>

<p>All benefices except those under the clear annual value of £50
pay their first fruits (one year&rsquo;s profits) and tenths (of yearly
profits) to Queen Anne&rsquo;s Bounty for the augmentation of the
maintenance of the poorer clergy. Their profits during vacation
belong to the next incumbent. Tithe rent charge attached to a
benefice is relieved from payment of one-half of the agricultural
rates assessed thereon. Benefices may be exchanged by agreement
between incumbents with the consent of the ordinary, and
they may, with the consent of the patron and ordinary, be united
or dissolved after being united. They may also be charged with
the repayment of money laid out for their permanent advantage,
and be augmented wholly by the medium of Queen Anne&rsquo;s
Bounty.</p>

<p>A benefice is avoided or vacated&mdash;(1) by death; (2) by resignation,
if the bishop is willing to accept the resignation: by the Incumbents&rsquo;
Resignation Act 1871, Amendment Act 1887, any clergyman
who has been an incumbent of one benefice continuously for
seven years, and is incapacitated by permanent mental or bodily
infirmities from fulfilling his duties, may, if the bishop thinks fit,
have a commission appointed to consider the fitness of his
resigning; and if the commission report in favour of his resigning,
he may, with the consent of the patron (or, if that is refused,
with the consent of the archbishop) resign the cure of souls into
the bishop&rsquo;s hands, and have assigned to him, out of the benefice,
a retiring-pension not exceeding one-third of its annual value,
which is recoverable as a debt from his successor; (3) by cession,
upon the clerk being instituted to another benefice or some other
preferment incompatible with it; (4) by deprivation and sentence
of an ecclesiastical court; under the Clergy Discipline Act 1892,
an incumbent who has been convicted of offences against the law
of bastardy, or against whom judgment has been given in a
divorce or matrimonial cause, is deprived, and on being found
guilty in the consistory court of immorality or ecclesiastical
offences (not in respect of doctrine or ritual), he may be deprived
or suspended or declared incapable of preferment; (5) by act of
law in consequence of simony; (6) by default of the clerk in
neglecting to read publicly in the church the Book of Common
Prayer, and to declare his assent thereto within two months after

<p><span class="bold">BENEKE, FRIEDRICH EDUARD<a name="ar191" id="ar191"></a></span> (1798-1854), German
psychologist, was born at Berlin on the 17th of February 1798,
studied at the universities of Halle and Berlin, and served as a
volunteer in the war of 1815. After studying theology under
Schleiermacher and De Wette, he turned to pure philosophy,
studying particularly English writers and the German modifiers
of Kantianism, such as Jacobi, Fries and Schopenhauer. In 1820
he published his <i>Erkenntnisslehre</i>, his <i>Erfahrungsseelenlehre als
Grundlage alles Wissens</i>, and his inaugural dissertation <i>De Veris
Philosophiae Initiis</i>. His marked opposition to the philosophy
of Hegel, then dominant in Berlin, was shown more clearly in the
short tract, <i>Neue Grundlegung zur Metaphysik</i> (1822), intended
to be the programme for his lectures as privat-docent, and in the
able treatise, <i>Grundlegung zur Physlk der Sitten</i> (1822), written, in
direct antagonism to Kant&rsquo;s <i>Metaphysic of Ethics</i>, to deduce
ethical principles from a basis of empirical feeling. In 1822 his
lectures were prohibited at Berlin, according to his own belief
through the influence of Hegel with the Prussian authorities, who
also prevented him from obtaining a chair from the Saxon
government. He retired to Göttingen, lectured there for some
years, and was then allowed to return to Berlin. In 1832 he
received an appointment as <i>professor extraordinarius</i> in the
university, which he continued to hold till his death. On the 1st
of March 1854 he disappeared, and more than two years later his
remains were found in the canal near Charlottenburg. There was
some suspicion that he had committed suicide in a fit of mental
depression.</p>

<p>The distinctive peculiarity of Beneke&rsquo;s system consists, first,
in the firmness with which he maintained that in empirical
psychology is to be found the basis of all philosophy; and
secondly, in his rigid treatment of mental phenomena by the
genetic method. According to him, the perfected mind is a
development from simple elements, and the first problem of
philosophy is the determination of these elements and of the
processes by which the development takes place. In his <i>Neue
Psychologie</i>, (essays iii., viii. and ix.), he defined his position with
regard to his predecessors and contemporaries, and both there
and in the introduction to his <i>Lehrbuch</i> signalized as the two great
stages in the progress of psychology the negation of innate ideas
by Locke, and of faculties, in the ordinary acceptation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page727" id="page727"></a>727</span>
term, by Herbart. The next step was his own; he insisted that
psychology must be treated as one of the natural sciences. As is
the case with them, its content is given by experience alone, and
differs from theirs only in being the object of the internal as
opposed to the external sense. But by this Beneke in no wise
meant a psychology founded on physiology. These two sciences,
in his opinion, had quite distinct provinces and gave no mutual
assistance. Just as little help is to be expected from the science
of the body as from mathematics and metaphysics, both of which
had been pressed by Herbart into the service of psychology. The
true method of study is that applied with so much success in the
physical sciences&mdash;critical examination of the given experience,
and reference of it to ultimate causes, which may not be themselves
perceived, but are nevertheless hypotheses necessary to account
for the facts. (See on method, <i>Neue Psych.</i>, essay i.)</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Starting from the two assumptions that there is nothing, or at
least no formed product, innate in the mind, and that definite
faculties do not originally exist, and from the fact that our minds
nevertheless actually have a definite content and definite modes of
action, Beneke proceeds to state somewhat dogmatically his
scientifically verifiable hypotheses as to the primitive condition of
the soul and the laws according to which it develops. Originally the
soul is possessed of or is an immense variety of powers, faculties or
forces (conceptions which Beneke, in opposition to Herbart, holds to
be metaphysically justifiable), differing from one another only in
tenacity, vivacity, receptivity and grouping. These primitive
immaterial forces, so closely united as to form but one being (essence),
acquire definiteness or form through the action upon them of <i>stimuli</i>
or excitants from the outer world. This action of external
impressions which are appropriated by the internal powers is the first
fundamental process in the genesis of the completed mind. If the
union of impression and faculty be sufficiently strong, consciousness
(not <i>self</i>-consciousness) arises, and definite sensations and
perceptions begin to be formed. These primitive sensations, however,
are not to be identified with the sensations of the special senses,
for each of these senses is a system of many powers which have grown
into a definite unity, have been educated by experience. From ordinary
experience it must be concluded that a second fundamental process
is incessantly going on, viz. the formation of new powers, which
takes place principally during sleep. The third and most important
process results from the fact that the combination between stimulus
and power may be weak or strong; if weak, then the two elements
are said to be movable, and they may flow over from one to another
of the already formed psychical products. Any formed faculty
does not cease to exist on the removal of its stimulus; in virtue of
its fundamental property, <i>tenacity</i>, it sinks back as a trace
(<i>Spur</i>) into unconsciousness, whence it may be recalled by the
application to it of another stimulus, or by the attraction towards
it of some of the movable elements or newly-formed original powers.
These traces and the flowing over of the movable elements are the most
important conceptions in Beneke&rsquo;s psychology; by means of them
he gives a rationale of reproduction and association, and strives to
show that all the formed faculties are simply developments from
traces of earlier processes. Lastly, similar forms, according to the
degree of their similarity, attract one another or tend to form closer
combinations.</p>

<p>All psychical phenomena are explicable by the relation of impression
and power, and by the flow of movable elements; the whole
process of mental development is nothing but the result of the action
and interaction of the above simple laws. In general this growth
may be said to take the direction of rendering more and more definite
by repetition and attraction of like to like the originally indefinite
activities of the primary faculties. Thus the sensations of the
special senses are gradually formed from the primary sensuous feelings
(<i>sinnliche Empfindungen</i>); concepts are formed from intuitions
of individuals by the attraction of the common elements, and
the consequent flow towards them of movable forms. Judgment is
the springing into consciousness of a concept alongside of an
intuition, or of a higher concept alongside of a lower. Reasoning is
merely a more complex judgment. Nor are there special faculties
of judging or reasoning. The understanding is simply the mass of
concepts lying in the background of unconsciousness, ready to be
called up and to flow with force towards anything closely connected
with them. Even memory is not a special faculty; it is simply the
fundamental property of tenacity possessed by the original faculties.
The very distinction between the great classes, Knowledge, Feeling
and Will, may be referred to elementary differences in the original
relations of faculty and impression.</p>

<p>This is the groundwork of Beneke&rsquo;s philosophy. It should be
carefully compared with the association psychology of modern
British thinkers, most of whose results and processes will be found
there worked into a comprehensive system (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Association of
Ideas</a></span>). In logic, metaphysics and ethics Beneke&rsquo;s speculations
are naturally dependent on his psychology.</p>

<p>The special value of Beneke&rsquo;s works, as has been already said,
consists in the many specimens of acute psychological analysis
scattered throughout them. As a complete explanation of psychical
facts, the theory seems defective. The original hypotheses, peculiar
to Beneke, on which the whole depends, are hastily assumed and
rest on a clumsy mechanical metaphor. As is the case with all
empirical theories of mental development, the higher categories
or notions, which are apparently shown to result from the simple
elements, are really presupposed at every step. Particularly
unsatisfactory is the account of consciousness, which is said to arise
from the union of impression and faculty. The necessity of
consciousness for any mental action whatsoever is apparently granted,
but the conditions involved in it are never discussed or mentioned.
The same defect appears in the account of ethical judgment; no
amount of empirical fact can ever yield the notion of absolute duty.
His results have found acceptance mainly with practical teachers.
Undoubtedly his minute analysis of temperament and careful
exposition of the means whereby the young, unformed mind may be
trained are of infinite value; but the truth of many of his doctrines
on these points lends no support to the fundamental hypotheses,
from which, indeed, they might be almost entirely severed.</p>

<p>Beneke was a most prolific writer, and besides the works mentioned
above, published large treatises in the several departments of
philosophy, both pure and as applied to education and ordinary
life. A complete list of his writings will be found in the appendix
to Dressler&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Lehrbuch der Psychologie als
Naturwissenschaft</i> (1861).
The chief are:&mdash;<i>Psychologische Skizzen</i> (1825, 1827);
<i>Lehrbuch der Psychologie</i> (1832);
<i>Metaphysik und Religionsphilosophie</i> (1840);
<i>Die neue Psychologie</i> (1845); <i>Pragmatische Psychologie
oder Seelenlehre in der Anwendung auf das Leben</i> (1832).</p>

<p>Among German writers, who, though not professed followers of
Beneke, have been largely influenced by him, may be mentioned
Ueberweg and Karl Fortlage (1806-1881). In England, perhaps,
the only writer who shows traces of acquaintance with his works
is J.D. Morell (<i>Introd. to Mental Philosophy</i>). The most eminent
members of the school are J.G. Dressler (whose <i>Beneke oder
Seelenlehre als Naturwissenschaft</i> is an admirable exposition),
Fried. Dittes and G. Raue. The compendium by the last-named author
passed through four editions in Germany, and has been translated into
French, Flemish and English. The English translation, <i>Elements
of Psychology</i> (1871), gives a lucid and succinct view of the whole
system.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENEVENTO,<a name="ar193" id="ar193"></a></span> a town and archiepiscopal see of Campania,
Italy, capital of the province of Benevento, 60 m. by rail and
32 m. direct N.E. of Naples, situated on a hill 400 ft. above
sea-level at the confluence of the Calore and Sabbato. Pop.
(1901) town, 17,227; commune, 24,137. It occupies the site of
the ancient Beneventum, originally Maleventum or Maluentum,
supposed in the imperial period to have been founded by Diomedes.
It was the chief town of the Samnites, who took refuge
here after their defeat by the Romans in 314 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> It appears not
to have fallen into the hands of the latter until Pyrrhus&rsquo;s absence
in Sicily, but served them as a base of operations in the last
campaign against him in 275 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> A Latin colony was planted
there in 268 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and it was then that the name was changed for
the sake of the omen, and probably then that the Via Appia was
extended from Capua to Beneventum. It remained in the hands
of the Romans during both the Punic and the Social Wars, and
was a fortress of importance to them. The position is strong,
being protected by the two rivers mentioned, and the medieval
fortifications, which are nearly 2 m. in length, probably follow
the ancient line, which was razed to the ground by Totila in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page728" id="page728"></a>728</span>
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 542. After the Social War it became a <i>municipium</i> and
under Augustus a colony. Being a meeting point of six main
roads,<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> it was much visited by travellers. Its importance is
vouched for by the many remains of antiquity which it possesses,
of which the most famous is the triumphal arch erected in honour
of Trajan by the senate and people of Rome in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 114, with
important reliefs relating to its history (E. Petersen in
<i>Römische Mitteilungen</i>, 1892, 241; A. von Domaszewzki in
<i>Jahreshefte des Österreich. archäologischen Instituts</i>, ii., 1899, 173).
There are also considerable remains of the ancient theatre, a
large <i>cryptoporticus</i> 197 ft. long known as the ruins of Santi
Quaranta, and probably an emporium (according to Meomartini,
the portion preserved is only a fraction of the whole, which once
measured 1791 ft. in length) and an ancient brick arch (called
the Arco del Sacramento), while below the town is the Ponte
Lebroso, a bridge of the Via Appia over the Sabbato, and along
the road to Avellino are remains of <i>thermae</i>. Many inscriptions
and ancient fragments may be seen built into the houses; in
front of the Madonna delle Grazie is a bull in red Egyptian
granite, and in the Piazza Papiniano the fragments of two
Egyptian obelisks erected in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 88 in front of the temple of
Isis in honour of Domitian. In 1903 the foundations of this
temple were discovered close to the Arch of Trajan, and many
fragments of fine sculptures in both the Egyptian and the
Greco-Roman style belonging to it were found. They had
apparently been used as the foundation of a portion of the city
wall, reconstructed in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 663 under the fear of an attack by
Constans, the Byzantine emperor, the temple having been
destroyed under the influence of the bishop, St Barbatus, to
provide the necessary material (A. Meomartini, O. Marucchi
and L. Savignoni in <i>Notizie degli Scavi</i>, 1904, 107 sqq.). Not
long after it had been sacked by Totila Benevento became the
seat of a powerful Lombard duchy and continued to be independent
until 1053, when the emperor Henry III. ceded it to
Leo IX. in exchange for the bishopric of Bamberg; and it
continued to be a papal possession until 1806, when Napoleon
granted it to Talleyrand with the title of prince. In 1815 it
returned to the papacy, but was united to Italy in 1860. Manfred
lost his life in 1266 in battle with Charles of Anjou not far from
the town. Much damage has been done by earthquakes from
time to time. The church of S. Sofia, a circular edifice of about
760, now modernized, the roof of which is supported by six
ancient columns, is a relic of the Lombard period; it has a fine
cloister of the 12th century constructed in part of fragments of
earlier buildings; while the cathedral with its fine arcaded
façade and incomplete square campanile (begun in 1279) dates
from the 9th century and was rebuilt in 1114. The bronze doors,
adorned with bas-reliefs, are good; they may belong to the
beginning of the 13th century. The interior is in the form of a
basilica, the double aisles being borne by ancient columns, and
contains <i>ambones</i> and a candelabrum of 1311, the former resting
on columns supported by lions, and decorated with reliefs and
coloured marble mosaic. The castle at the highest point of the
town was erected in the 14th century.</p>

and has branch lines to Campobasso and to Avellino.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENEVOLENCE<a name="ar194" id="ar194"></a></span> (Lat. <i>bene</i>, well, and <i>volens</i>, wishing), a term
for an act of kindness, or a gift of money, or goods, but used in a
special sense to indicate sums of money, disguised as gifts, which
were extorted by various English kings from their subjects,
without consent of parliament. Among the numerous methods
which have been adopted by sovereigns everywhere to obtain
support from their people, that of demanding gifts has frequently
found a place, and consequently it is the word and not the method
which is peculiar to English history. Edward II. and Richard II.
had obtained funds by resorting to forced loans, a practice which
was probably not unusual in earlier times. Edward IV., however,
discarded even the pretence of repayment, and in 1473 the word
<i>benevolence</i> was first used with reference to a royal demand for a
gift. Edward was very successful in these efforts, and as they
only concerned a limited number of persons he did not incur
serious unpopularity. But when Richard III. sought to emulate
his brother&rsquo;s example, protests were made which led to the
passing of an act of parliament in 1484 abolishing benevolences
as &ldquo;new and unlawful inventions.&rdquo; About the same time the
Chronicle of Croyland referred to a benevolence as a &ldquo;nova et
inaudita impositio muneris ut per benevolentiam quilibet daret
id quod vellet, immo verius quod nollet.&rdquo; In spite of this act
Richard demanded a further benevolence; but it was Henry VII.
who made the most extensive use of this system. In 1491 he sent
out commissioners to obtain gifts of money, and in 1496 an act
of parliament enforced payment of the sums promised on this
occasion under penalty of imprisonment. Henry&rsquo;s chancellor,
Cardinal Morton, archbishop of Canterbury, was the traditional
author of a method of raising money by benevolences known as
&ldquo;Morton&rsquo;s Fork.&rdquo; If a man lived economically, it was reasoned
he was saving money and could afford a present for the king. If,
on the contrary, he lived sumptuously, he was evidently wealthy
and could likewise afford a gift. Henry VII. obtained considerable
sums of money in this manner; and in 1545 Henry VIII.
demanded a &ldquo;loving contribution&rdquo; from all who possessed lands
worth not less than forty shillings a year, or chattels to the value
of £15; and those who refused to make payment were summoned
before the privy council and punished. Elizabeth took loans
which were often repaid; and in 1614 James I. ordered the
sheriffs and magistrates in each county and borough to collect a
general benevolence from all persons of ability, and with some
difficulty about £40,000 was collected. Four counties had, however,
distinguished themselves by protests against this demand,
and the act of Richard III. had been cited by various objectors.
Representatives from the four counties were accordingly called
before the privy council, where Sir Edward Coke defended the
action of the king, quoted the Tudor precedents and urged that
the act of 1484 was to prevent exactions, not voluntary gifts such
as James had requested. Subsequently Oliver St John was fined
and imprisoned for making a violent protest against the benevolence,
and on the occasion of his trial Sir Francis Bacon defended
the request for money as voluntary. In 1615 an attempt to exact
a benevolence in Ireland failed, and in 1620 it was decided to
demand one for the defence of the Palatinate. Circular letters
were sent out, punishments were inflicted, but many excuses were
made and only about £34,000 was contributed. In 1621 a further
attempt was made, judges of assize and others were ordered to
press for contributions, and wealthy men were called before the
privy council and asked to name a sum at which to be rated.
About £88,000 was thus raised, and in 1622 William Fiennes, 1st
Viscount Saye and Sele, was imprisoned for six months for
protesting. This was the last time benevolences were actually
collected, although in 1622 and 1625 it was proposed to raise
money in this manner. In 1633 Charles I. consented to collect
a benevolence for the recovery of the Palatinate for Charles
Louis, the son of his sister Elizabeth, but no further steps were
taken to carry out the project.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENFEY, THEODOR<a name="ar195" id="ar195"></a></span> (1809-1881), German philologist, son of
a Jewish trader at Nörten, near Göttingen, was born on the 28th
of January 1809. Although originally designed for the medical
profession, his taste for philology was awakened by a careful
instruction in Hebrew which he received from his father. After
brilliant studies at Göttingen he spent a year at Munich, where
he was greatly impressed by the lectures of Schelling and Thiersch,
and afterwards settled as a teacher in Frankfort. His pursuits
were at first chiefly classical, and his attention was diverted to
Sanskrit by an accidental wager that he would learn enough of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page729" id="page729"></a>729</span>
the language in a few weeks to be able to review a new book upon
it. This feat he accomplished, and rivalled in later years when
he learned Russian in order to translate V.P. Vasilev&rsquo;s work on
Buddhism. For the time, however, his labours were chiefly in
classical and Semitic philology. At Göttingen, whither he had
returned as privat-docent, he wrote a little work on the names of
the Hebrew months, proving that they were derived from the
Persian, prepared the great article on India in Ersch and Grüber&rsquo;s
<i>Encyclopaedia</i>, and published from 1839 to 1842 the <i>Lexicon of
Greek Roots</i> which gained him the Volney prize of the Institute
of France. From this time his attention was principally given
to Sanskrit. He published in 1848 his edition of the <i>S&#257;ma-veda</i>;
in 1852-1854 his <i>Manual of Sanskrit</i>, comprising a grammar and
chrestomathy; in 1858 his practical Sanskrit grammar, afterwards
translated into English; and in 1859 his edition of the
<i>Pantscha Tantra</i>, with an extensive dissertation on the fables
and mythologies of primitive nations. All these works had been
produced under the pressure of poverty, the government,
whether from parsimony or from prejudice against a Jew,
refusing to make any substantial addition to his small salary
as extra-professor at the university. At length, in 1862, the
growing appreciation of foreign scholars shamed it into making
him an ordinary professor, and in 1866 Benfey published the
laborious work by which he is on the whole best known, his
great <i>Sanskrit-English Dictionary</i>. In 1869 he wrote a history
of German philological research, especially Oriental, during the
19th century. In 1878 his jubilee as doctor was celebrated by
the publication of a volume of philological essays dedicated to
him and written by the first scholars in Germany. He had
designed to close his literary labours by a grammar of Vedic
Sanskrit, and was actively preparing it when he was interrupted
by illness, which terminated in his death at Göttingen on the
26th of June 1881.</p>

Bay of Bengal and Madras; on the W. by the Central Provinces
and United Provinces; and on the N. by Nepal and Sikkim.
It has an area of 141,580 sq. m. and a population of 54,096,806.
It consists of the provinces of Behar, Orissa and Chota Nagpur,

the six British divisions of the presidency, Bhagalpur, Patna,
Burdwan, Chota Nagpur and Orissa, and various native states.
The province was reconstituted in 1905, when the Chittagong,
Dacca and Rajshahi divisions, the district of Malda and the state
of Hill Tippera were transferred from Bengal to a new province,
Eastern Bengal and Assam; the five Hindi-speaking states of

<p>The name Bengal is derived from Sanskrit geography, and
applies strictly to the country stretching southwards from
Bhagalpur to the sea. The ancient Banga formed one of the five
outlying kingdoms of Aryan India, and was practically conterminous
with the delta of Bengal. It derived its name, according
to the etymology of the Pundits, from a prince of the Mahabharata,
to whose portion it fell on the primitive partition of the
country among the Lunar race of Delhi. But a city called
Bangala, near Chittagong, which, although now washed away,
is supposed to have existed in the Mahommedan period, appears
to have given the name to the European world. The word
Bangala was first used by the Mussulmans; and under their rule,
like the Banga of old Sanskrit times, it applied specifically to
the Gangetic delta, although the later conquests to the east of
the Brahmaputra were eventually included within it. In their
distribution of the country for fiscal purposes, it formed the
central province of a governorship, with Behar on the north-west,
and Orissa on the south-west, jointly ruled by one deputy of the
Delhi emperor. Under the English the name has at different
periods borne very different significations. Francis Fernandez
applies it to the country from the extreme east of Chittagong
to Point Palmyras in Orissa, with a coast line which Purchas
estimates at 600 m., running inland for the same distance and
watered by the Ganges. This territory would include the
Mahommedan province of Bengal, with parts of Behar and
Orissa. The loose idea thus derived from old voyagers became
stereotyped in the archives of the East India Company. All its
north-eastern factories, from Balasore, on the Orissa coast, to
Patna, in the heart of Behar, belonged to the &ldquo;Bengal Establishment,&rdquo;
and as British conquests crept higher up the rivers,
the term came to be applied to the whole of northern India.
The presidency of Bengal, in contradistinction to those of Madras
and Bombay, eventually included all the British territories
north of the Central Provinces, from the mouths of the Ganges
and Brahmaputra to the Himalayas and the Punjab. In 1831
the North-Western Provinces were created, which are now
included with Oudh in the United Provinces; and the whole
of northern India is now divided into the four lieutenant-governorships
of the Punjab, the United Provinces, Bengal, and
Eastern Bengal and Assam, and the North-West Frontier Province
under a commissioner.</p>

<p><i>Physical Geography</i>.&mdash;Three sub-provinces of the present
lieutenant-governorship of Bengal&mdash;namely, Bengal proper,
Behar and Orissa&mdash;consist of great river valleys; the fourth,
Chota Nagpur, is a mountainous region which separates them
from the central India plateau. Orissa embraces the rich deltas
of the Mahanadi and the neighbouring rivers, bounded by the
Bay of Bengal on the S.E., and walled in on the N.W. by tributary
hill states. Proceeding west, the sub-province of Bengal proper
stretches to the banks of the Ganges and inland from the sea-board
to the Himalayas. Its southern portion is formed by the
delta of the Ganges; its northern consists of the Ganges valley.
Behar lies on the north-west of Bengal proper, and comprises,
the higher valley of the Ganges from the spot where it issues
from the United Provinces. Between Behar and Orissa lies the
province of Chota Nagpur, of which a portion was given in 1905
to the Central Provinces. The valley of the Ganges, which is
now divided between Bengal and Eastern Bengal and Assam,
is one of the most fertile and densely-populated tracts of country
in the world. It teems with every product of nature. Tea,
indigo, turmeric, lac, waving white fields of the opium-poppy,
wheat and innumerable grains and pulses, pepper, ginger, betel-nut,
quinine and many costly spices and drugs, oil-seeds of sorts,
cotton, the silk mulberry, inexhaustible crops of jute and other
fibres; timber, from the feathery bamboo and coroneted palm
to the iron-hearted <i>sál</i> tree&mdash;in short, every vegetable product
which feeds and clothes a people, and enables it to trade with
foreign nations, abounds. Nor is the country destitute of mineral
wealth. The districts near the sea consist entirely of alluvial
formations; and, indeed, it is stated that no substance so coarse
as gravel occurs throughout the delta, or in the heart of the
provinces within 400 m. of the river mouths.</p>

<p>The climate varies from the snowy regions of the Himalayas
to the tropical vapour-bath of the delta and the burning winds
of Behar. The ordinary range of the thermometer,
<span class="sidenote">Climate.</span>
on the plains is from about 52° F. in the coldest
month to 103° in the shade in summer. A temperature below
60° is considered very cold, while with care the temperature of
well-built houses rarely exceeds 95° in the hot weather. The
rainfall varies from 37 in. in Behar to about 65 in. in the delta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page730" id="page730"></a>730</span></p>

<p>Lower Bengal exhibits the two typical stages in the life of a
great river. In the northern districts the rivers run along the
valleys, receive the drainage from the country on
either side, absorb broad tributaries and rush forward
<span class="sidenote">Rivers.</span>
with an ever-increasing volume. But near the centre of the
provinces the rivers enter upon a new stage of their career.
Their main channels bifurcate, and each new stream so created
throws off its own set of distributaries to right and left. The
country which they thus enclose and intersect forms the delta
of Bengal. Originally conquered by the fluvial deposits from the
sea, it now stretches out as a vast dead level, in which the rivers
find their velocity checked, and their current no longer able to
carry along the silt which they have brought down from northern
India. The streams, accordingly, deposit their alluvial burden
in their channels and upon their banks, so that by degrees their
beds rise above the level of the surrounding country. In this
way the rivers in the delta slowly build themselves up into
canals, which every autumn break through or overflow their
margins, and leave their silt upon the adjacent flats. Thousands
of square miles in Lower Bengal annually receive a top-dressing
of virgin soil from the Himalayas,&mdash;a system of natural manuring
which renders elaborate tillage a waste of labour, and defies the
utmost power of over-cropping to exhaust its fertility. As the
rivers creep farther down the delta, they become more and more
sluggish, and their bifurcations and interfacings more complicated.
The last scene of all is a vast amphibious wilderness of swamp
and forest, amid whose solitudes their network of channels
insensibly merges into the sea. The rivers, finally checked by
the sea, deposit their remaining silt, which emerges as banks
or blunted promontories, or, after a year&rsquo;s battling with the
tide, adds a few feet or it may be a few inches to the foreshore.</p>

<p>The Ganges gives to the country its peculiar character and
aspect. About 200 m. from its mouth it spreads out into
numerous branches, forming a large delta, composed, where it
borders on the sea, of a labyrinth of creeks and rivers, running
through the dense forests of the Sundarbans, and exhibiting
during the annual inundation the appearance of an immense sea.
At this time the rice fields to the extent of many hundreds of
square miles are submerged. The scene presents to a European
eye a panorama of singular novelty and interest&mdash;rice fields
covered with water to a great depth; the ears of grain floating
on the surface; the stupendous embankments, which restrain
without altogether preventing the excesses of the inundations;
and peasants going out to their daily work with their cattle in
canoes or on rafts. The navigable streams which fall into the
Ganges intersect the country in every direction and afford great
facilities for internal communication. In many parts boats can
approach by means of lakes, rivulets and water-courses to the
door of almost every cottage. The lower region of the Ganges
is the richest and most productive portion of Bengal, abounding
in valuable produce. The other principal rivers in Bengal are
the Sone, Gogra, Gandak, Kusi, Tista; the Hugli, formed by the
junction of the Bhagirathi and Jalangi, and farther to the west,
the Damodar and Rupnarayan; and in the south-west, the Mahanadi
or great river of Orissa. In a level country like Bengal, where
the soil is composed of yielding and loose materials, the courses
of the rivers are continually shifting from the wearing
away of their different banks, or from the water being turned
off by obstacles in its course into a different channel. As this
channel is gradually widened the old bed of the river is left dry.
The new channel into which the river flows is of course so much
land lost, while the old bed constitutes an accession to the
adjacent estates. Thus, one man&rsquo;s property is diminished,
while that of another is enlarged or improved; and a distinct
branch of jurisprudence has grown up, the particular province
of which is the definition and regulation of the alluvial rights
alike of private property and of the state.</p>

<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The greater part of Bengal is occupied by the
alluvial deposits of the Ganges, but in the south-west rises the
plateau of Chota Nagpur composed chiefly of gneissic rocks.
The great thickness of the Gangetic alluvium is shown by a
borehole at Calcutta which was carried to a depth of about
460 ft. below the present level of the sea without entering any
marine deposit. Over the surface of the gneissic rocks are
scattered numerous basins of Gondwana beds. Some of these
are undoubtedly faulted into their present positions, and to this
they owe their preservation. In the Rajmahal Hills basaltic
lava flows are interbedded with the Gondwana deposits, and in
the Karharbari coalfield the Gondwana beds are traversed by
dikes of mica-peridotite and basalt, which are supposed to be of
the same age as the Rajmahal lavas. The Gondwana series is
economically of great importance. It includes numerous seams
of coal, many of which are worked on an extensive scale (at
Giridih, Raniganj, &amp;c.). The quality of the coal is good, but
unfortunately it contains a large amount of ash, the average
being as high as 17%.</p>

<p><i>People.</i>&mdash;In the sub-provinces under the lieutenant-governor
of Bengal dwell a great congeries of peoples, of widely diverse
origin, speaking different languages and representing far
separated eras of civilization. The province, in fact, became so
unwieldy that this was the chief reason for its partition in 1905.
The people exhibit every stage of human progress, and every
type of human enlightenment and superstition from the educated
classes to primitive hill tribes. On the same bench of a Calcutta
college sit youths trained up in the strictest theism, others
indoctrinated in the mysteries of the Hindu trinity and pantheon,
with representatives of every link in the chain of superstition&mdash;from
the harmless offering of flowers before the family god to
the cruel rites of Kali, whose altars in the most civilized districts
of Bengal, as lately as the famine of 1866, were stained with
human blood. Indeed, the very word Hindu is one of absolutely
indeterminate meaning. The census officers employ it as a
convenient generic to include 42 millions of the population of
Bengal, comprising elements of transparently distinct ethnical
origin, and separated from each other by their language, customs
and religious rites. But Hinduism, understood even in this wide
sense, represents only one of many creeds and races found within
Bengal. The other great historical cultus, which during the
last twelve centuries did for the Semitic peoples what
Christianity accomplished among the European Aryans, has won to
itself one-fifth of the population of Bengal. The Mahommedans
number some 9,000,000 in Bengal, but the great bulk of their
numbers was transferred to Eastern Bengal and Assam. They
consist largely of the original inhabitants of the country, who
were proselytized by the successive Pathan and Mogul invasions.
In the face of great natural catastrophes, such as river inundations,
famines, tidal waves and cyclones of the lower provinces
of Bengal, the religious instinct works with a vitality unknown
in European countries. Until the British government stepped
in with its police and canals and railroads, between the people
and what they were accustomed to consider the dealings of
Providence, scarcely a year passed without some terrible
manifestation of the power and the wrath of God. Mahratta invasions
from central India, piratical devastations on the sea-board,
banditti who marched about the interior in bodies of 50,000 men,
floods which drowned the harvests of whole districts, and
droughts in which a third of the population starved to death,
kept alive a sense of human powerlessness in the presence of an
omnipotent fate. Under the Mahommedans a pestilence turned
the capital into a silent wilderness, never again to be re-peopled.
Under British rule it is estimated that 10 millions perished
within the Lower Provinces alone in the famine of 1769-1770;
and the first surveyor-general of Bengal entered on his maps a
tract of many hundreds of square miles as bare of villages and
&ldquo;depopulated by the Maghs.&rdquo; But since the advent of British
administration the history of Bengal has substantially been a
record of prosperity; the teeming population of its river valleys
is one of the densest in the world, and the purely agricultural
districts of Saran and Muzaffarpur in the Patna division support
over 900 persons to the square mile, a number hardly surpassed
elsewhere except in urban areas.</p>

<p><i>Language.</i>&mdash;Excluding immigrants the languages spoken by
the people of Bengal belong to one or other of four linguistic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page731" id="page731"></a>731</span>
families&mdash;Aryan, Dravidian, Munda and Tibeto-Burman. Of
these the languages of the Aryan family are by far the most
important, being spoken by no less than 95% of the population
according to the census of 1901. The Aryan languages are spoken
in the plains by almost the whole population; the Munda and
Dravidian in the Chota Nagpur plateau and adjoining tracts;
and the Tibeto-Burman in Darjeeling, Sikkim and Jalpaiguri.
The most important Aryan languages are Bengali (<i>q.v.</i>), Bihari,
Eastern Hindi and Oriya. On the average in the province,
before partition, out of every 1000 persons 528 spoke Bengali,
341 Hindi and Bihari, and 79 Oriya. As a rule Bengali is the
language of Bengal proper, Hindi of Behar and Chota Nagpur,
and Oriya of Orissa.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The staple crop of the province is rice, to which
about 66% of the cropped area is devoted. There are three
harvests in the year&mdash;the <i>boro</i>, or spring rice; <i>áus</i>, or autumn
rice; and <i>áman</i>, or winter rice. Of these the last or winter rice
is by far the most extensively cultivated, and forms the great
harvest of the year. The <i>áman</i> crop is grown on low land. In
May, after the first fall of rain, a nursery ground is ploughed
three times, and the seed scattered broadcast. When the seedlings
make their appearance another field is prepared for transplanting.
By this time the rainy season has thoroughly set in,
and the field is dammed up so as to retain the water. It is then
repeatedly ploughed until the water becomes worked into the
soil, and the whole reduced to thick mud. The young rice is then
taken from the nursery, and transplanted in rows about 9 in. apart.
<i>Áman</i> rice is much more extensively cultivated than <i>áus</i>,
and in favourable years is the most valuable crop, but being
sown in low lands is liable to be destroyed by excessive rainfall.
Harvest takes place in December or January. <i>Áus</i> rice is
generally sown on high ground. The field is ploughed when the
early rains set in, ten or twelve times over, till the soil is reduced
nearly to dust, the seed being sown broadcast in April or May.
As soon as the young plants reach 6 in. in height, the land is
harrowed for the purpose of thinning the crop and to clear it of
weeds. The crop is harvested in August or September. <i>Boro</i>, or
spring rice, is cultivated on low marshy land, being sown in a
nursery in October, transplanted a month later, and harvested
in March and April. An indigenous description of rice, called <i>uri</i>
or <i>jaradhán</i>, grows in certain marshy tracts. The grain is very
small, and is gathered for consumption only by the poorest.
Wheat forms an important food staple in Behar, whence there is
a considerable export to Calcutta. Oil-seeds are very largely
grown, particularly in Behar. The principal oil-seeds are <i>sarisha</i>
(mustard), <i>til</i> (sesamum) and <i>lisi</i> or <i>masina</i> (linseed).
Jute (<i>pat</i> or <i>kosta</i>) forms a very important commercial staple
of Bengal. The cultivation of this crop has rapidly increased of late years.
Its principal seat of cultivation, however, is Eastern Bengal,
where the superior varieties are grown. The crop grows on
either high or low lands, is sown in April and cut in August.
Apart from the quantity exported and the quantity made up by
hand, it supports a prosperous mill industry, chiefly in the
neighbourhood of Calcutta and Howrah. In 1905 there were thirty-six
jute mills in the province and 2¼ million acres were cropped.
The value of jute and of the goods manufactured from it
represents more than a third of the aggregate value of the trade
of Calcutta. Indigo used to be an important crop carried on
with European capital in Behar, but of late years the industry
has almost been destroyed by the invention of artificial indigo.
Tea cultivation is the other great industry carried on by European
capital, but that is chiefly confined to Assam, the industry in
Darjeeling and the Dwars being on a small scale. Opium is
grown in Behar with its head station at Patna. The cultivation
of the cinchona plant in Bengal was introduced as an experiment
about 1862, and is grown on government plantations in Darjeeling.</p>

<p><i>Mineral Products.</i>&mdash;The chief mineral product in Bengal is coal,
which disputes with the gold of Mysore for the place of premier
importance in the mining industries of India. The most important
mine in point of area, accessibility and output is Raniganj,
with an area of 500 sq. m. Another of rising importance is that of
Jherria, with an area of 200 sq. m., which is situated only 16 m. to
the west of Raniganj; while Daltonganj also has an area of 200
sq. m. The small coalfield of Karharbari with an area of only
11 sq. m. yields the best coal in Bengal. Besides these four
coalfields there are twenty-five others of various sizes, which are
only in the initial stages of development.</p>

<p><i>Commerce.</i>&mdash;The sea-borne trade of Bengal is almost entirely
concentrated at Calcutta (<i>q.v.</i>), which also serves as the chief port
for Eastern Bengal and Assam, and for the United Provinces.
The principal imports are cotton piece goods, railway materials,
metals and machinery, oils, sugar, cotton, twist and salt; and the
principal exports are jute, tea, hides, opium, rice, oil-seeds, indigo
and lac. The inter-provincial trade is mostly carried on with
Eastern Bengal and Assam, the United Provinces and the Central
Provinces. From the United Provinces come opium, hides, raw
cotton, wheat, shellac and oil-seeds; and from Assam, tea,
oil-seeds and jute. The frontier trade of Bengal is registered
with Nepal, Sikkim, Tibet and Bhutan, but except with Nepal
the amount is insignificant.</p>

<p><i>Railways.</i>&mdash;Bengal is well supplied with railways, which
naturally have the seaport of Calcutta as the centre of the system.
South of the Ganges, the East Indian follows the river from the
North-Western Provinces, with its terminus at Howrah on the
Hugli, opposite Calcutta. A chord line passes by the coalfield of
Raniganj, which enables this great railway to be worked more
economically than any other in India. The Bengal-Nagpur,
from the Central Provinces, also has its terminus at Howrah,
and the section of this railway through Midnapore carries the East
Coast line from Madras. North of the Ganges the Eastern
Bengal runs north to Darjeeling, and maintains a service of river
steamers on the Brahmaputra. The Bengal Central serves the
lower Gangetic delta. Both of these have their termini at Sealdah,
an eastern suburb of Calcutta. Northern Behar is traversed by
the Bengal &amp; North-Western, with an extension eastwards
through Tirhoot to join the Eastern Bengal. In addition there
are a few light lines and steam tramways.</p>

<p><i>Canals and Rivers.</i>&mdash;Rivers and other waterways still carry a
large part of the traffic of Bengal, especially in the delta. The
government maintains two channels through the Sundarbans,
known as the Calcutta and Eastern canals, and likewise does its
best to keep open the Nadiya rivers, which form the communication
between the main stream of the Ganges and the Hugli.
There is further a route by water between Calcutta and Midnapore.
The most important canals, those in Orissa (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mahanadi</a></span>) and
on the Sone river in southern Behar, have been constructed
primarily for irrigation, though they are also used for navigation.
Except as a protection against famine, expenditure on irrigation
is not remunerative in Bengal, on account of the abundance of
rivers, and the general dampness of the climate.</p>

<p><i>Administration.</i>&mdash;The administration of Bengal is conducted
by a lieutenant-governor, with a chief secretary, two secretaries
and three under-secretaries. There is no executive council, as in
Madras and Bombay; but there is a board of revenue, consisting
of two members. For legislative purposes the lieutenant-governor
has a council of twenty members, of whom not more
than ten may be officials. Of the remaining members seven are
nominated on the recommendation of the Calcutta corporation,
groups of municipalities, groups of district boards, selected public
associations and the senate of Calcutta university. The number
of divisions or commissionerships is 6, of which Chota Nagpur
ranks as &ldquo;non-regulation.&rdquo; The number of districts is 33.</p>

<p><i>Army.</i>&mdash;In Lord Kitchener&rsquo;s reconstitution of the Indian
army in 1904 the old Bengal command was abolished and its
place taken by the Eastern army corps, which includes all the
troops from Meerut to Assam. The boundaries of the 8th
division include those of the former Oudh, Allahabad, Assam
and Presidency districts; and the troops now quartered in
Bengal only consist of the Presidency brigade with its headquarters
at Fort William.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The history of so large a province as Bengal forms
an integral part of the general history of India. The northern
part, Behar (<i>q.v.</i>), constituted the ancient kingdom of Magadha,
the nucleus of the imperial power of the successive great dynasties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page732" id="page732"></a>732</span>
of the Mauryas, Andhras and Guptas; and its chief town, Patna,
is the ancient Pataliputra (the Palimbothra of the Greeks), once
the capital of India. The Delta or southern part of Bengal lay
beyond the ancient Sanskrit polity, and was governed by a
number of local kings belonging to a pre-Aryan stock. The
Chinese travellers, Fa Hien in the 5th century, and Hsüan
Tsang in the 7th century, found the Buddhist religion prevailing
throughout Bengal, but already in a fierce struggle with
Hinduism&mdash;a struggle which ended about the 9th or 10th century
in the general establishment of the latter faith. Until the end
of the 12th century Hindu princes governed in a number of petty
principalities, till, in 1199, Mahommed Bakhtiyar Khilji was
appointed to lead the first Mussulman invasion into Bengal.
The Mahommedan conquest of Behar dates from 1197 <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, and
the new power speedily spread southwards into the delta. From
about this date until 1340 Bengal was ruled by governors
appointed by the Mahommedan emperors in the north. From
1340 to 1539 its governors asserted a precarious independence,
and arrogated the position of sovereigns on their own account.
From 1540 to 1576 Bengal passed under the rule of the Pathan
or Afghan dynasty, which commonly bears the name of Sher
Shah. On the overthrow of this house by the powerful arms of
Akbar, Bengal was incorporated into the Mogul empire, and
administered by governors appointed by the Delhi emperor,
until the treaties of 1765, which placed Bengal, Behar and
Orissa under the administration of the East India Company.
The Company formed its earliest settlements in Bengal in the
first half of the 17th century. These settlements were of a purely
commercial character. In 1620 one of the Company&rsquo;s factors
dates from Patna; in 1624-1636 the Company established itself,
by the favour of the emperor, on the ruins of the ancient Portuguese
settlement of Pippli, in the north of Orissa; in 1640-1642
an English surgeon, Gabriel Boughton, obtained establishments
at Balasore, also in Orissa, and at Hugli, some miles above
Calcutta. The vexations and extortions to which the Company&rsquo;s
early agents were subjected more than once almost induced
them to abandon the trade, and in 1677-1678 they threatened
to withdraw from Bengal altogether. In 1685, the Bengal
factors, driven to extremity by the oppression of the Mogul
governors, threw down the gauntlet; and after various successes
and hairbreadth escapes, purchased from the grandson of
Aurangzeb, in 1696, the villages which have since grown up into
Calcutta, the metropolis of India. During the next fifty years
the British had a long and hazardous struggle alike with the
Mogul governors of the province and the Mahratta armies which
invaded it. In 1756 this struggle culminated in the great outrage
known as the Black Hole of Calcutta, followed by Clive&rsquo;s battle
of Plassey and capture of Calcutta, which avenged it. That
battle, and the subsequent years of confused fighting, established
British military supremacy in Bengal, and procured the treaties
of 1765, by which the provinces of Bengal, Behar and Orissa
passed under British administration. To Warren Hastings
(1772-1785) belongs the glory of consolidating the British power,
and converting a military occupation into a stable civil government.
To another member of the civil service, John Shore,
afterwards Lord Teignmouth (1786-1793), is due the formation
of a regular system of Anglo-Indian legislation. Acting through
Lord Cornwallis, then governor-general, he ascertained and
defined the rights of the landholders in the soil. These landholders
under the native system had started, for the most part,
as collectors of the revenues, and gradually acquired certain
prescriptive rights as quasi-proprietors of the estates entrusted
to them by the government. In 1793 Lord Cornwallis declared
their rights perpetual, and made over the land of Bengal to the
previous quasi-proprietors or <i>zamíndárs</i>, on condition of the
payment of a fixed land tax. This piece of legislation is known
as the Permanent Settlement of the Land Revenue. But the
Cornwallis code, while defining the rights of the proprietors,
failed to give adequate recognition to the rights of the undertenants
and the cultivators. His Regulations formally reserved
the latter class of rights, but did not legally define them, or
enable the husbandmen to enforce them in the courts. After
half a century of rural disquiet, the rights of the cultivators
were at length carefully formulated by Act X. of 1859. This
measure, now known as the land law of Bengal, effected for the
rights of the under-holders and cultivators what the Cornwallis
code in 1793 had effected for those of the superior landholders.
The status of each class of persons interested in the soil, from
the government as suzerain, through the <i>zamíndárs</i> or superior
landholders, the intermediate tenure-holders and the undertenants,
down to the actual cultivator, is now clearly defined.
The act dates from the first year after the transfer of India from
the company to the crown; for the mutiny burst out in 1857.
The transactions of that revolt chiefly took place in northern
India, and are narrated in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indian Mutiny</a></span>. In
Bengal the rising began at Barrackpore, was communicated
to Dacca in Eastern Bengal, and for a time raged in Behar,
producing the memorable defence of the billiard-room at Arrah
by a handful of civilians and Sikhs&mdash;one of the most splendid
pieces of gallantry in the history of the British arms. Since
1858, when the country passed to the crown, the history of Bengal
has been one of steady progress. Five great lines of railway
have been constructed. Trade has enormously expanded; new
centres of commerce have sprung up in spots which formerly
were silent jungles; new staples of trade, such as tea and jute,
have rapidly attained importance; and the coalfields and iron
ores have opened up prospects of a new and splendid era in the
internal development of the country.</p>

<p>During the decade 1891-1901 Bengal was fortunate in escaping
to a great extent the two calamities of famine and plague which
afflicted central and western India. The drought of 1896-1897
did indeed extend to Bengal, but not to such an extent as to
cause actual famine. The distress was most acute in the densely
populated districts of northern Behar, and in the remote hills
of Chota Nagpur. Plague first appeared at Calcutta in a sporadic
form in April 1898, but down to April of the following year the
total number of deaths ascribed to plague throughout the
province was less than 1000, compared with 191,000 for Bombay.
At the beginning of 1900, however, there was a serious recrudescence
of plague at Calcutta, and a malignant outbreak in the
district of Patna, which caused 1000 deaths a week. In the
early months of 1901, plague again appeared in the same regions.
The number of deaths in 1904 was 75,436, the highest recorded
up to that date.</p>

<p>The earthquake of the 12th of June 1897, which had its centre
of disturbance in Assam, was felt throughout eastern and
northern Bengal. In all the large towns the masonry buildings
were severely damaged or totally wrecked. The permanent way
of the railways also suffered. The total number of deaths
returned was only 135. Far more destructive to life was the
cyclone and storm-wave that broke over Chittagong district on
the night of the 24th of October 1897. Apart from damage to
shipping and buildings, the low-lying lands along the coast were
completely submerged, and in many villages half the inhabitants
were drowned. The loss of human lives was reported to be about
14,000, and the number of cattle drowned about 15,000. As
usual in such cases, a severe outbreak of cholera followed in the
track of the storm-wave. Another natural calamity on a large
scale occurred at Darjeeling in October 1899. Torrential rains
caused a series of landslips, carrying away houses and breaking
up the hill railway.</p>

<p>The most notable event, however, of recent times was the
partition of the province, which was decided upon by Lord
Curzon, and carried into execution in October 1905. Serious
popular agitation followed this step, on the ground (<i>inter alia</i>)
that the Bengali population, the centre of whose interests and
prosperity was Calcutta, would now be divided under two
governments, instead of being concentrated and numerically
dominant under the one; while the bulk would be in the new
division. In 1906-1909 the unrest developed to a considerable
extent, requiring special attention from the Indian and home
governments; but as part of the general history of India the
movement may be best discussed under that heading (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">India</a></span>:
<i>History</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENGAL, BAY OF,<a name="ar197" id="ar197"></a></span> a portion of the Indian Ocean, resembling
a triangle in shape, lying between India and Burma. A zone
50 m. wide extending from the island of Ceylon and the Coromandel
coast to the head of the bay, and thence southwards
through a strip embracing the Andaman and Nicobar islands, is
bounded by the 100 fathom line of sea bottom; some 50 m.
beyond this lies the 500-fathom limit. Opposite the mouth of the
Ganges, however, the intervals between these depths are very
much extended by deltaic influence. The bay receives many
large rivers, of which the most important are the Ganges and
Brahmaputra on the north, the Irrawaddy on the east, and the
Mahanadi, Godavari, Kistna and Cauvery on the west. On the
west coast it has no harbours, Madras having a mere open
roadstead, but on the east there are many good ports, such as
Akyab, Moulmein, Rangoon and Tavoy river. The islands in
the bay are very numerous, including the Andaman, Nicobar
and Mergui groups. The group of islands, Cheduba and others,
in the north-east, off the Burmese coast, are remarkable for a
chain of mud volcanoes, which are occasionally active. Thus in
December 1906 a new island of mud was thrown up, and measured
307 by 217 yds.</p>

<p>Of these Bihari is treated separately. In the present article we
shall devote ourselves to the examination of Bengali together
with the two other closely connected languages. The reader is
throughout assumed to be in possession of the facts described
under the heads <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-Aryan Languages</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span>.</p>

<p>Bengali is spoken in the province of Bengal proper, <i>i.e.</i> in, and
on both sides of the delta of the Ganges, and also in the Eastern
Bengal portion of the province of Eastern Bengal and
Assam. The name &ldquo;Bengali&rdquo; is an English word,
<span class="sidenote">Language.</span>
derived from the English word &ldquo;Bengal.&rdquo; Natives call the
language <i>Banga-Bh&#257;&#7779;&#257;</i>, or the language of Banga, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;Bengal.&rdquo;
&ldquo;O&#343;iy&#257;&rdquo; is the native name for the language of &#332;&#7693;ra or Orissa.
Assamese, again an English word, is spoken in the Assam Valley.
Its native name is <i>Asamiy&#257;</i>, pronounced <i>Ohåmiy&#257;</i>. All these
languages have alphabets derived from early forms of the
well-known Nagari character of northern India. That of
Bengali dates from about the 11th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> It is a cursive
script which admits of considerable speed in writing. The
Assamese alphabet is the same as that of Bengali, but has one
additional character to represent the sound of <i>w</i>, which has to be
expressed in the former language in a very awkward fashion. In
Orissa, till lately, writing was done on a talipot palm-leaf, on
which the letters were scratched with an iron stylus. In such
circumstances straight lines would tend to split the leaf, and
accordingly the alphabet received a peculiar curved appearance
typical of it and of one or two other South Indian methods of
writing.</p>

<p>The three languages are all the immediate descendants of
M&#257;gadh&#299; Prakrit (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span>), the headquarters of which were
in south Behar, near the modern city of Patna. From here it
spread in three lines&mdash;southwards, where it developed into
Oriya; south-eastwards into Bengal proper, where it became
Bengali; and eastwards, through Northern Bengal, into Assam,
where it became Assamese. It thus appears that the language of
Northern Bengal, though usually and conveniently treated as a
dialect of Bengali, is not so in reality, but is a connecting link
between Assamese and Bihari, the language of Behar. It is
noteworthy that Northern Bengali and Assamese often agree in
their grammar with Oriya, as against standard Bengali.</p>

<p>Omitting border forms of speech, Bengali, as a vernacular,
has two main dialects, a western and an eastern, the former
being the standard. The boundary-line between the two may
be roughly put at the 89th degree of east longitude. The eastern
dialect has many marked peculiarities, amongst which we may
mention a tendency to disaspiration, the pronunciation of <i>c</i> as
<i>ts</i>, of <i>ch</i> as <i>s</i>, and of <i>j</i> as <i>z</i>. In the northern part of the tract a
medial <i>r</i> is often elided, and in the extreme east there is a broader
pronunciation of the vowel <i>a</i>, like that in the English word
&ldquo;ball,&rdquo; <i>k</i> is sounded like the <i>ch</i> in &ldquo;loch,&rdquo; and both <i>c</i> and <i>ch</i>
are pronounced like <i>s</i>. The letter <i>p</i> is often sounded like <i>w</i>, and
<i>s</i> like <i>h</i>, which again, when initial, is dropped. The distinction
between cerebral and dental letters is lost, so that the words
<i>&#257;&#355;h</i> and <i>s&#257;t</i> are both pronounced <i>&rsquo;&#257;t</i>. In the south-east, near
Chittagong, corruption has gone even further, and the local
dialect, which is practically a new language, is unintelligible
to a man from Western Bengal. Throughout the eastern
districts there is a strong tendency to epenthesis, <i>e.g. k&#257;li</i> is
pronounced <i>k&#257;&#301;l</i>. A more important dialectic difference in
Bengali is that between the literary speech and the vernacular.
The literary vocabulary is highly Sanskritized, so much so
that it is not understood by any native of Bengal who has
not received special instruction in it. Its grammar preserves
numerous archaic or pseudo-archaic forms, which are invariably
contracted in the colloquial speech of even the most highly
educated. For instance, &ldquo;I do&rdquo; is expressed in the literary
dialect by <i>karit&#275;chi</i>, but in the vernacular by <i>k&#7887;rcci</i> or <i>k&#7887;cci</i>.
Oriya and Assamese may be said to have no dialects. There
are a few local variations, but the standard form of speech, as a
whole, is used everywhere in the respective tracts where the
languages are spoken.</p>

<p>The three languages, being all children of a common parent,
present many similar features. Oriya on the whole preserves
the usual accentuation of the Indo-Aryan Languages (<i>q.v.</i>),
seldom having the stress syllable farther back than the antepenultimate.
Bengali, on the other hand, throws the accent
as far back as possible, and this produces the contracted forms
which we observe in the colloquial language, the first syllable
of a word being strongly accented, and the rest being hurried
over. Literary Bengali preserves the full form of the word, and
in reading aloud this full form is adhered to. Assamese follows
Bengali in its accentuation, but the language has never been the
toy of euphuism. In its literature colloquial words are employed,
and are written as they are pronounced colloquially.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the following account of the three languages, Bengali, literary
and colloquial, will be primarily dealt with, and then the points of
difference between it and the other two will be described. Abbreviations
used: A. = Assamese, Bg. = Bengali, O. = Oriya, Pr. = Prakrit,
Mg. Pr. = M&#257;gadhi Prakrit, Skr. = Sanskrit.</p>

<p><i>Vocabulary.</i>&mdash;As already said, Literary Bengali abounds in
<i>tatsamas</i>, or words borrowed in modern times from Sanskrit (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-Aryan Languages</a></span>), and these have also intruded themselves
into the speech of the educated. So much has the false taste for
these learned words obtained the mastery that, in the literary language,
when a genuine Bengali or <i>tadbhava</i> word is used in literature
it is frequently not put into writing, but the corresponding learned
<i>tatsama</i> is written in its place, although the <i>tadbhava</i> is read. It is
as though a French writer wrote <i>sicca</i> when he wished the word
<i>sèche</i> to be pronounced. Similarly, the Bengali word for the goddess
of Fortune is <i>Lakkh&#299;</i>, but in books this is always written in the Skr.
form <i>Lak&#7779;m&#299;</i>, although no Bengali would dream of saying anything
but <i>Lakkh&#299;</i>, even when reciting a purple passage <i>ore rotunda</i>. In fact,
the vocal organs of most Bengalis are incapable of uttering the sound
connoted by the letters <i>Lak&#7779;m&#299;</i>. The result is that the spelling of a
Bengali word rarely represents its pronunciation. Oriya also borrows
freely from Sanskrit, but there is no confusion between <i>tatsamas</i>
and <i>tadbhavas</i>, as in Bengali. Assamese, on the other hand, is remarkably
free from these parasites, its vocabulary being mainly
<i>tadbhava</i>. In Eastern Bengal, where Mussulmans predominate,
there is a free use of words borrowed from Arabic and Persian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page734" id="page734"></a>734</span>
Owing to geographical and historical circumstances, Oriya is to
some extent infected by Telugu and Marathi idioms, while the
Tibeto-Burman dialects and Ahom have left their marks upon Assamese.</p>

<p><i>Phonetics.</i>&mdash;The three forms of speech agree in sounding the vowel
<i>a</i> like the <i>&#7887;</i> in &ldquo;hot.&rdquo; When writing phonetically, this sound is
represented in the present article by <i>&#7887;</i>. The pronunciation of this
frequently recurring vowel gives a tone to the general sound of the
languages which at once strikes a foreigner. In Bg. and A. a final
vowel preceded by a single consonant is generally not pronounced.
In Bg. this is only true for nouns, a final <i>a</i> being freely sounded
in adjectives and verbs. In O., on the other hand, a final <i>a</i> is always
pronounced. The sound of such a final <i>a</i> is in all three languages
the same as that of the <span class="correction" title="amended from seccond">second</span> <i>o</i> in &ldquo;promote&rdquo;; thus, the Bg. <i>bara</i>
is pronounced <i>b&#7887;&#343;&#333;</i>. In Bg. a medial <i>a</i> sometimes has the sound of
the first <i>o</i> in &ldquo;promote,&rdquo; as, for instance, in the word <i>ban</i> (<i>bon</i>), a
forest. In A. and Eastern Bg. a medial <i>a</i> is often sounded like the
<i>a</i> in &ldquo;ball,&rdquo; and is then transliterated <i>&#7843;</i>. <i>&#256;</i> has preserved as a rule
its proper sound of <i>a</i> in &ldquo;father.&rdquo; The distinction between <i>i</i> and <i>&#299;</i>
and between <i>u</i> and <i>&#363;</i> is everywhere lost in pronunciation, although
in <i>tatsama</i> words the Sanskrit spelling is followed in literature. Thus,
in Bg., the Skr. <i>vyat&#299;ta</i> is pronounced <i>bétít&#333;</i>, with the accent on the
first syllable. In A. the distinction between these long and short
vowels is obliterated more than elsewhere, the reason being, as in
Bg., the changes of pronunciation due to the shifting back of the
accent. In O., the Skr. vowel <i>&#343;</i> is pronounced <i>ru</i>. Elsewhere it is
<i>ri</i>. In O. the vowel <i>&#275;</i> is always long, but in Bg. it may be long or
short, and in A. it is always short. The syllable <i>ya</i> preceded by a
consonant has in Bg. the sound of a short <i>e</i>, so that <i>vyakti</i> is pronounced
<i>bekti</i>. Moreover, in the same language the letter <i>&#275;</i> is often
pronounced like the <i>a</i> in the German <i>Mann</i>, a sound here phonetically
represented by <i>a</i>; thus, <i>d&#275;kha</i> is sometimes pronounced <i>dekh&#333;</i>,
and sometimes <i>d&#7843;kh&#333;</i> or even <i>d&#7843;k&#333;</i>. The syllable <i>y&#257;</i>, when following
a consonant, also has this <i>&#7843;</i>-sound, so that the English word &ldquo;bank&rdquo;
is written <i>by&#257;nk</i> in Bengali characters. <i>&#332;</i> in O. is always long.
In Bg., when it has not got the accent it is shortened to the sound of
the first <i>o</i> in &ldquo;promote,&rdquo; a sound which, as we have seen, is also
sometimes taken by a medial <i>a</i>. In A. <i>&#333;</i> approaches the sound of <i>u</i>,
and it actually becomes <i>u</i> when followed by <i>i</i> in the next syllable.
The diphthongs <i>&#257;&#299;</i> (in <i>tatsamas</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the Skr. <i>&#257;i</i>) and <i>ai</i> (in <i>tadbhavas</i>)
are sounded like <i>oi</i> in &ldquo;oil&rdquo; in Bg. and O., while in A. they have the
sound of <i>oi</i> in &ldquo;going.&rdquo; Similarly, in Bg. and O. the diphthongs
<i>&#257;&#363;</i> and <i>au</i> are sounded like the <i>au</i> in the German <i>Haus</i>, but in A.
like <i>au</i> in the French <i>jaune</i>, or the second <i>o</i> in &ldquo;promote.&rdquo; In
colloquial Bg. the two syllables <i>&#257;i</i> often have the sound of <i>&#275;</i>, as in
<i>kh&#257;it&#275;</i> (<i>kh&#275;t&#275;</i>), to eat.</p>

<p>In Eastern Bengal <i>k</i> has often the sound of <i>ch</i> in &ldquo;loch.&rdquo; In A.
the consonants <i>c</i> and <i>ch</i> are both pronounced like <i>s</i>, and <i>j</i> and <i>jh</i>
become <i>zh</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the <i>s</i> in &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo;) or (when final) <i>z</i>. The same
tendency is observable in Bg., though it is usually considered vulgar.
In parts of Eastern Bengal <i>c</i> is pronounced like <i>ts</i>. O. as a rule has
the proper sound of these letters, but towards the south <i>c</i> and <i>ch</i>
become <i>ts</i> and <i>tsh</i> when not followed by a palatal letter. The letters
<i>&#7693;</i> and <i>&#7693;h</i>, when medial, are pronounced as a strongly burred <i>r</i>, and
are then transliterated <i>&#343;</i> and <i>&#343;h</i> respectively. In A. and Eastern Bg.
there is a strong tendency to pronounce both dentals and cerebrals
as semi-cerebrals, as is done by the neighbouring Tibeto-Burmans.
In A. <i>&#343;</i> and <i>&#343;h</i> become <i>r</i> and <i>rh</i> respectively. In Bg. and A. <i>&#7751;</i> has
universally become <i>n</i>, but is properly pronounced in O. <i>Y</i> is usually
pronounced as <i>j</i>, unless it is a merely euphonic bridge to avoid a
hiatus between two vowels, as in <i>kariy&#257;</i> for <i>kari-&#257;</i>. In A. the resultant
<i>j</i> has the usual <i>z</i>-sound. When <i>y</i> is the final element of a
conjunct consonant, in Bg. (except in the south-east) it is very
faintly pronounced. In compensation the preceding member of the
conjunct is doubled and the preceding vowel is shortened if possible,
thus <i>v&#257;kya</i> becomes <i>b&#7843;kk<span class="sp">y</span>&#333;</i>. In A., while the <i>y</i> is usually preserved,
an <i>i</i> is inserted before the conjunct, so that we have <i>b&#257;iky&#333;</i>. <i>M</i> and
<i>v</i> when similarly situated are altogether elided in Bg., and this is also
the case with <i>v</i> in A., in which language <i>m</i> under these circumstances
becomes <i>w</i>; thus, <i>smara&#7751;a</i> becomes Bg. <i>&#347;&#347;&#7887;r&#7887;n</i>, A. <i>sw&#7887;r&#7887;n</i>, and <i>dv&#257;r&#257;</i>
becomes Bg. and A. <i>dd&#257;r&#257;</i>. <i>R</i> is generally pronounced correctly,
except that when a member of a compound it is often not pronounced
in colloquial Bg.; thus <i>karma</i> (<i>k&#7887;mm&#333;</i>). In North-eastern Bengali
and in A. a medial <i>r</i> is commonly dropped; thus, Bg. <i>karil&#257;m</i>
(<i>kaïl&#257;m</i>), A. <i>kari</i> (<i>kaï</i>).<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The vulgar commonly confound <i>n</i> and <i>l</i>.
O. has retained the old cerebral <i>&#7735;</i> of Pr., which has disappeared in
Bg. and A. The semi-vowel <i>v</i> (<i>w</i>) becomes <i>b</i> in Bg. and O., but retains
its proper sound when medial in A. When Bg. wishes to represent
a <i>w</i>, it has to write <i>&#333;y&#257;</i>; thus, for <i>ch&#257;w&#257;</i> it writes <i>ch&#257;&#333;y&#257;</i>. Similarly
<i>b&#257;r&#333;</i>, twelve, <span class="su">+</span><i>y&#257;ri</i>, friendship, when compounded together to mean
&ldquo;a collection of twelve friends,&rdquo; is pronounced <i>b&#257;rw&#257;ri</i>. Bg. pronounces
all uncompounded sibilants as if they were <i>&#347;</i>, like the
English <i>sh</i> in &ldquo;shin.&rdquo; This was already the case in Mg. Pr. (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span>). O., on the contrary, pronounces all three like the dental
<i>s</i> in &ldquo;sin,&rdquo; while A. sounds them like a rough <i>h</i>, almost like the <i>ch</i>
in &ldquo;loch.&rdquo; In Eastern Bg. <i>s</i> becomes frankly <i>h</i>, and is then often
dropped. The compound <i>k&#7779;</i> is everywhere treated as if it were <i>khy</i>,
In colloquial Bg. there is a tendency to disaspiration; thus <i>d&#275;kha</i>
is pronounced <i>d&#7843;k&#333;</i> and the Pr. <i>hattha-</i>, a hand, becomes <i>h&#257;t</i>, not
<i>h&#257;th</i>. In Eastern Bg. there is a cockney tendency to drop <i>h</i>, so that
we have <i>&rsquo;&#257;t</i>, a hand, and <i>kaïl&#257;m</i> for <i>kahil&#257;m</i>, I said.</p>

<p>The above remarks show that O. has, on the whole, preserved
the original sounds of the various letters better than Bg. or A.</p>

<p><i>Declension.</i>&mdash;The distinction of gender has disappeared from all
three languages. Sex is distinguished either by the use of qualifying
terms, such as &ldquo;male&rdquo; or &ldquo;female,&rdquo; or by the employment of
different words, as in the case of our &ldquo;bull&rdquo; and &ldquo;cow.&rdquo;  The
plural number is almost always denoted by the addition of some
word meaning &ldquo;many&rdquo; or &ldquo;collection&rdquo; to the singular, although
we sometimes find a true plural used in the case of nouns denoting
human beings. Case was originally indicated by postpositions (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-Aryan Languages</a></span>), but in many instances these have been
joined to the noun, so that they form one word with it. The following
is the full declension of the singular of the word <i>gh&#333;&#343;&#257;</i>, a horse, in
the three languages:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p class="noind">In Bg. and A. a noun often takes <i>&#275;</i> (<i>e</i>) in the nominative singular,
when it is the subject of a transitive verb; thus Bg. <i>b&#275;de&#275;</i> (from <i>b&#275;d</i>)
<i>bal&#275;</i>, the Veda says.  In Bg. the nominative plural may, in the case
of human beings, be formed by adding <i>&#257;</i> to the genitive singular;
thus, <i>sant&#257;n</i>, a son; gen. sing., <i>sant&#257;n&#275;r</i>; nom. plur., <i>sant&#257;n&#275;ra</i>.
The same is the case with the pronouns; thus <i>&#257;m&#257;r</i>, of me; <i>&#257;mar&#257;</i>,
we; <i>t&#257;h&#257;r</i>, his; <i>t&#257;h&#257;r&#257;</i>, they.  In Bihari (<i>q.v.</i>) the pronouns follow
the same rule, and, as is explained under that head, the nominative
plural is really an oblique form of the genitive. With this exception,
the plural in all our three languages is either the same as the singular,
or (when the idea of plurality has to be emphasized) is formed by the
addition of nouns of multitude, such as <i>ga&#7751;</i> in Bg., <i>m&#257;na</i> in O., or
<i>bil&#257;k</i> in A.</p>

<p>We shall see that pronominal suffixes are freely used in all three
languages in the conjugation of verbs.  In the Outer languages of
the north-west of India (for the list of these, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-Aryan
Languages</a></span>) pronominal suffixes are also commonly added to nouns
to signify possession. In most of the languages of the Eastern
Group such pronominal suffixes added to nouns have fallen into
disuse, but in A. they are still commonly employed with nouns of
relationship; thus, <i>b&#257;p</i>, a father; <i>bop&#257;i</i>, my father; <i>b&#257;per</i>, your
father; <i>b&#257;pek</i>, his father. Their retention in A. is no doubt due
to the example of the neighbouring Tibeto-Burman languages, in
which such pronominal <i>prefixes</i> are a common feature.</p>

<p>In all three languages the adjective does not change for gender,
for number or for case.</p>

<p>The personal pronouns have at the present day lost their old
nominatives, and have new nominatives formed from the oblique
base. In the first and second persons the singulars have fallen into
disuse in polite conversation, and the plurals are used honorifically
for the singular, as in the case of the English &ldquo;you&rdquo; for &ldquo;thou.&rdquo;
For the plural, new plurals are formed from the new singular (old
plural) bases. In A., however, the old singular of the first person is
retained, and the old plural plays its proper function. The Bg.
pronouns  are, <i>mui</i> (old), I; <i>&#257;mi</i> (modern), I; <i>tui</i> (old), thou; <i>tumi</i>
(modern), thou; <i>s&#275;</i>, <i>tini</i>, he; <i>&#275;</i>, <i>ini</i>, this; <i>&#333;</i>, <i>uni</i>, that; <i>j&#275;</i>, <i>jini</i>,
who; <i>k&#275;</i>, who?; <i>ki</i>, what?; <i>k&#333;n</i>, what (adjective)?; <i>k&#275;ha</i>, anyone;
<i>kichu</i>, anything; <i>k&#333;na</i>, any. Most of the forms in the other languages
closely follow these. The words in O. for &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;thou&rdquo;
are <i>ambh&#275;</i> and <i>tumbh&#275;</i> respectively. All these pronouns have plurals
and oblique forms to which the case suffixes are added. These must
be learnt from the grammars.</p>

<p><i>Conjugation</i>.&mdash;It is in the conjugation of the verb that colloquial
Bg. differs most from the literary dialect. There is no distinction
in any of the three languages between singular and plural. Most
of the old singular forms have survived in a non-honorific sense, but
they are rarely employed in polite language except in the third
person. The old plural forms are generally employed for the singular
also. The usual base for the verb substantive, when employed as an
auxiliary, is <i>ach</i>, be, derived from the Skr. <i>&#343;cchati</i>. O., however,
forms its past from the base <i>tha</i> (Skr. <i>sthita-</i>), and in South-western
Bengal the base <i>&#355;ha</i>, derived from the same original, is used for both
present and past time. Only two of the old Skr.-Pr. tenses have
survived in the finite verb, the simple present and the imperative.
Thus, Bg. <i>kari</i>, I do; <i>kar</i>, do thou. The past is formed by adding
pronominal suffixes to the old past participle in <i>il</i> (Skr. <i>-illa-</i>, a
pleonastic suffix, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Prakrit</a></span>), and the future by adding them to
the old future participle in <i>b</i> (Skr. <i>-tavya-</i>, Pr. <i>-avva-</i>). Thus, Bg.
<i>karil-&#257;m</i>, done + by-me, I did; <i>karib-a</i>, it-is-to-be-done + by-me, I
shall do. In Bg. there are two modern participles, a present (<i>kar-it&#275;</i>)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page735" id="page735"></a>735</span>
and a past (<i>kar-iy&#257;</i>), and from these there are formed periphrastic
tenses by suffixing auxiliary verbs. Thus,
<i>karite-chi</i> (colloquial, <i>k&#7887;rci</i> or <i>k&#7887;cci</i>), I am doing;
<i>karit&#275;-chil&#257;m</i> (coll. <i>korcilum</i> or <i>k&#7887;ccilum</i>), I was doing;
<i>kariy&#257;-chi</i> (coll., <i>korsi</i>), I have done;
<i>kariy&#257;-chil&#257;m</i> (coll., <i>korsilum</i>), I had done.
A past conditional is formed by adding pronominal suffixes
to the present participle; thus, <i>karit&#257;m</i> (coll., <i>kortum</i>
or <i>kottum</i>), (if) I had done. Similar tenses are formed in O. and A.,
but the periphrastic tenses are formed with verbal nouns and not
with participles. Thus, O. <i>karu-ach&#299;</i>, A. <i>kari-chõ</i>, I am a-doing,
I am doing. O. and A. have each a very complete series of gerunds
or verbal nouns which are fully declined. In Bg. only one gerund,
that of the genitive, is in common use.</p>

<p>In order to illustrate the conjugation of the verb, we here give
that of the root <i>kar</i>, do, in its present, past and future tenses.</p>

<p><i>Bengali Literature.</i>&mdash;The oldest recognized writer in Bengali
is the Vaishnava poet Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#299; D&#257;s, who flourished about the
end of the 14th or the beginning of the 15th century.
His language does not differ much from the
<span class="sidenote">Literature.</span>
Bengali of to-day. He founded a school of poets who wrote
hymns in honour of Krishna, many of whom, in later times,
became connected with the religious revival instituted by
Caitanya in the early part of the 16th century. In the 15th
century K&#257;&#347;&#299; R&#257;m translated the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i>, and Krttib&#257;s
Ojh&#257; the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> into the vernacular. The principal figure
of the 17th century was Mukunda R&#257;m who has left us two
really admirable poems entitled <i>Ca&#7751;&#7693;&#299;</i> and <i>&#346;r&#299;manta Saud&#257;gar</i>.
Parts of the former have been translated by Professor Cowell
into English verse, and both well deserve putting into an English
dress. With Bh&#257;rat Candra, whose much admired but artificial
Bidy&#257; Sundar appeared in the 18th century, the list of old
Bengali authors may be considered as closed. They wrote in
genuine nervous Bengali, and the conspicuous success of many
of them shows how baseless is the contention of some native
writers of the present day that modern literary Bengali needs
the help of its huge imported Sanskrit vocabulary to express
anything but the simplest ideas. This modern literary Bengali
arose early in the 19th century, as a child of the revival of
Sanskrit learning in Calcutta, under the influence of the college
founded by the English in Fort William. Each decade it has
become more and more the slave of Sanskrit. It has had some
excellent writers, notably the late Bankim Candra, whose novels
have received the honour of being translated into several
languages, including English. Even he, however, sometimes
laboured under the fetters imposed upon him by a strange
vocabulary, and all competent European scholars are agreed
that no work of first-class originality has much chance of arising
in Bengal till some great genius purges the language of its
pseudo-classical element.</p>

<p><i>Oriya Literature</i> does not go back beyond the 16th century,
though examples of the language are found in inscriptions of the
13th century. Nearly all the works are connected with the
history of Krishna, and the translation of the <i>Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>
into Oriya in the first half of the 16th century still exercises
great influence on the masses. D&#299;na K&#343;&#7779;&#7751;a D&#257;s (17th century)
was the author of another popular work entitled <i>Rasa Kallola</i>,
or &ldquo;The Waves of Sentiment,&rdquo; which deals with the early life
of Krishna. Every verse in it begins with the letter <i>k</i>. It is not
always decent, but is immensely popular. Up&#275;ndra Bhañja, R&#257;j&#257;
of Gumsur, a petty hill state, is the most famous of Oriya poets,
and was the most prolific. His work is insipid to a European
taste, and when not unintelligible is often obscene. Oriya
poetry, from first to last, has been an artificial production, the
work of <i>pa&#7751;&#7693;its</i>, who clung to the rules of Sanskrit rhetoric,
and loaded their verses with so many ideas and words borrowed
from that language that it is rarely understood, except by the
learned. The whole literature is, in fact, overshadowed by the
great temple of Jagann&#257;th (a name of Krishna) at Puri in
Orissa.</p>

<p><i>Assamese Literature.</i>&mdash;The Assamese are justly proud of their
national literature. It has an independent growth, and its
strength lies in history, a branch of letters in which other Indian
languages are almost entirely wanting. They have chronicles
going back for the past 600 years, and a knowledge of their
contents is a necessary part of the education of the upper
classes of the country. In poetry, the Vaishnava reformer,
Sankar Deb, who flourished some 450 years ago, was a voluminous
writer. His best known work is a translation of the
<i>Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;&#7751;a</i>. About the same time Ananta Kandali
translated the <i>Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata</i> and the <i>R&#257;m&#257;ya&#7751;a</i> into his native
tongue. Medicine was a science much studied, and there are
translations of all the principal Sanskrit works on the subject.
Forty or fifty dramatic works in the vernacular are known and are
still acted. Some of them date back to the time of &#346;ankar D&#275;b.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;There is no work dealing with the three languages
as a group. Both the <i>Comparative Grammars</i> of Beames and Hoernle
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-Aryan Languages</a></span>) are silent about Assamese. The
fullest details concerning them all will be found in vol. v. of the
<i>Linguistic Survey of India</i>, parts i. and ii. (Calcutta, 1903).  In this
each dialect and subdialect is treated with great minuteness and with
copious examples.</p>

<p>The first Bengali grammar and dictionary in a European language
was the <i>Vocabulario em Idioma Bengalla e Portuguez</i> of Manoel da
Assumpçam (Lisbon, 1743). N.B. Halhed wrote the first Bengali
grammar in the English language (Hooghly, 1778), but the real
father of Bengali philology was the great missionary, William Carey
(<i>Grammar</i>, Serampore, 1801; <i>Dictionary, ib</i>., 1825). W. Yates&rsquo;s
<i>Grammar</i>, as edited and improved by T. Wenger (Calcutta, 1847)
and others, is still on sale. It is entirely confined to the literary
Bengali of the pa&#7751;&#7693;its. Its great rival has been &#346;y&#257;m&#257; Cara&#7751;
Sark&#257;r&rsquo;s <i>Grammar</i> (Calcutta, 1850), of which there have been
numerous reprints. In 1894 J. Beames published his <i>Grammar</i>
(Oxford), now the standard work on the subject. It is largely based
on &#346;y&#257;m&#257; Cara&#7751;&rsquo;s work, but with much new material, especially
that dealing with the colloquial side of the language. G.F. Nicholl&rsquo;s
<i>Grammar</i> (London, 1885) is an independent study of the language,
in which the vernacular works of the best native grammarians have
been freely utilized. There is no good Bengali dictionary. G.C.
Haughton&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i> (London, 1833) is perhaps still the best,
but J. Mendies&rsquo; (Calcutta, about 1870) is also well known, and is the
parent of countless others which have issued from the Calcutta
presses. <i>A Small Dictionary of Colloquial Bengali Words</i>, by J.M.C.
and G.A.C. (Calcutta, 1904), may also be studied with advantage.
Cf. also &#346;y&#257;m&#257;-cara&#7751; G&#257;&#7751;guli, <i>Bengali Spoken and Written</i> (Calcutta,
1906). For Bengali literature, see R.C. Dutt, <i>The Literature of
Bengal</i> (Calcutta and London, 1895), and Hara Pras&#257;d &#346;&#257;str&#299;, <i>The
Vernacular Literature of Bengal before the Introduction of English
Education</i> (Calcutta, n.d.). The most complete work is <i>Bangabh&#257;s&#257;
o S&#257;hitya</i> by D&#299;n&#275;&#347; Candra S&#275;n (2nd ed., Calcutta, 1901) in the
Bengali language.</p>

<p>For Oriya there are E. Hallam&rsquo;s (Calcutta, 1874), T. Maltby&rsquo;s
(Calcutta, 1874) and J. Browne&rsquo;s (London, 1882) <i>Grammars</i>. The
last two are in the Roman character. They are all mere sketches of
the language. Sutton&rsquo;s (Cuttack, 1841) is still the only <i>Dictionary</i>
which the present writer has found of any practical use. For Oriya
literature, see App. IX. of Hunter&rsquo;s <i>Orissa</i> (London, 1872), and
Monmohan Chakravarti&rsquo;s &ldquo;Notes on the Language and Literature of Orissa&rdquo;
in the <i>Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</i>, vol. lxvi.
(1897), part i. pp. 317 ff., and vol. lxvii. (1898), part i. pp. 332 ff.</p>

<p>The first Assamese <i>Grammar</i> was Nathan Brown&rsquo;s (Sibsagar, 1848,
3rd ed. 1893), and it is still the one usually studied. G.F. Nicholl
gives an Assamese grammar as a supplement to his Bengali <i>Grammar</i>
already quoted. Like that work, it is quite independent, and is not
a revised edition of Brown. M. Bronson&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i> (Sibsagar,
1867) was for long the only vocabulary available, and a very useful
and practical work it was. It is now superseded by Hem Candra
Ba&#343;u&#257;&rsquo;s <i>Hema-ko&#7779;a</i> (Shillong, 1900). For Assamese literature, see
Ananda R&#257;m Dheki&#257;l Phukan&rsquo;s <i>A Few Remarks on the Assamese Language</i>

<p><span class="bold">BENGAZI<a name="ar199" id="ar199"></a></span> (anc. <i>Hesperides-Berenice</i>), a seaport on the north
coast of Africa, capital of the sanjak of Bengazi or Barca,
formerly in the vilayet of Tripoli, but, since 1875, dependent
directly on the ministry of the interior at Constantinople. It
is situated on a narrow strip of land between the Gulf of Sidra
and a salt marsh, in 30° 7&prime; N. lat. and 20° 3&prime; E. long. Though
for the most part poorly built, it has one or two buildings of
some pretension&mdash;an ancient castle, a mosque, a Franciscan
monastery, government buildings and barracks. Senussi
influence is strong and there is a large <i>zawia</i> (convent). The
harbour is half silted up with sand and the ruins of fortifications
and is accessible only to vessels of light draught. A lighthouse
has been erected at the entrance, but reefs render approach
difficult, and the outer anchorage is fully exposed to west and
north and not good holding. The export trade is largely in
barley, shipped to British and other maltsters. The Sudan
produce (ivory, ostrich feathers, &amp;c.) formerly brought to
Bengazi by caravan, has now been almost wholly diverted to
Tripoli, the eastern tracks from Wadai and Borku by way of
Kufra to Aujila having become so unsafe that their natural
difficulties are no longer worth braving. Consular vigilance has
also killed the once considerable slave trade. Trade in other
commodities, however, is on the increase, exports now amounting
to nearly half a million sterling and imports to half that figure.
The neighbouring coast is frequented by Greek and Italian
sponge-fishers, the industry being a valuable one. The province
of Bengazi, being still without telegraphs or roads, is one of
the most backward in the Ottoman empire.</p>

<p>Founded by the Greeks of Cyrenaica under the name Hesperides,
the town received from Ptolemy III. the name of
Berenice in compliment to his wife. The ruins of the ancient
town, which superseded Cyrene and Barca as chief place in the
province after the 3rd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, are now nearly buried in
the sand. The modern town lies south-west of the original
site. Certain large natural pits which are found in the plain
behind, and have luxuriant gardens at the bottom, are supposed
to have originated the myth of the Gardens of the Hesperides.
Ancient tombs are found, which in 1882 yielded fine Greek
vases to G. Dennis, then British vice-consul. The present name
is derived from that of a Moslem saint whose tomb, near the
sea-coast, is an object of veneration. The population, amounting
to about 25,000, is greatly mixed. Levantines, Maltese, Greeks
and Jews form the trading community, but since 1895, when a
branch of the Agenzia Italiana Commerciale was established
at Bengazi, Italians have exercised an increasing influence on
Cyrenaic commerce. Turks, Arabs and Berbers are the ruling
castes, and negroes act as labourers and domestics. Many of
these found their way to Crete, and becoming porters, &amp;c. in
Canea and Candia, were notorious for turbulence and fanaticism.
In 1897 and 1898 the European admirals forcibly deported
consignments of the worst characters back to Bengazi. In 1858
and again in 1874 the town was devastated by plague (see also
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tripoli</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cyrenaica</a></span>).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BENGEL, JOHANN ALBRECHT<a name="ar200" id="ar200"></a></span> (1687-1752), Lutheran
divine and scholar, was born at Winnenden in Württemberg,
on the 24th of June 1687. His father died in 1693, and Bengel
was educated by a friend, who became a master in the gymnasium
at Stuttgart. In 1703 Bengel left Stuttgart and entered the
university of Tübingen, where, in his spare time, he devoted
himself specially to the works of Aristotle and Spinoza, and in
theology to those of Philipp Spener, Johann Arndt and August
Franke. His knowledge of the metaphysics of Spinoza was such
that he was selected by one of the professors to prepare materials
for a treatise <i>De Spinosismo</i>, which was afterwards published.
After taking his degree, Bengel devoted himself to theology.
Even at this time he had religious doubts; it is interesting in
view of his later work that one cause of his perplexities was the
difficulty of ascertaining the true reading of certain passages
in the Greek New Testament. In 1707 Bengel entered the ministry
and was appointed to the parochial charge of Metzingen-unter-Urach.
In the following year he was recalled to Tübingen
to undertake the office of <i>Repetent</i> or theological tutor. Here he
remained till 1713, when he was appointed head of a seminary
recently established at Denkendorf as a preparatory school of
theology. Before entering on his new duties he travelled
through the greater part of Germany, studying the systems of
education which were in use, and visiting the seminaries of the
Jesuits as well as those of the Lutheran and Reformed churches.
Among other places he went to Heidelberg and Halle, and had
his attention directed at Heidelberg to the canons of scripture
criticism published by Gerhard von Mästricht, and at Halle
to C. Vitringa&rsquo;s <i>Anacrisis ad Apocalypsin</i>. The influence exerted
by these upon his theological studies is manifest in some of his
works. For twenty-eight years&mdash;from 1713 to 1741&mdash;he was
master (<i>Klosterpräceptor</i>) of the <i>Klosterschule</i> at Denkendorf,
a seminary for candidates for the ministry established in a former
monastery of the canons of the Holy Sepulchre. To these years,
the period of his greatest intellectual activity, belong many of
his chief works. In 1741 he was appointed prelate (<i>i.e.</i> <i>General
Superintendent</i>) at Herbrechtingen, where he remained till 1749,
when he was raised to the dignity of consistorial counsellor and
prelate of Alpirspach, with a residence in Stuttgart. He now
devoted himself to the discharge of his duties as a member of
the consistory. A question of considerable difficulty was at that
time occupying the attention of the church courts, viz. the
manner in which those who separated themselves from the church
were to be dealt with, and the amount of toleration which
should be accorded to meetings held in private houses for the
purpose of religious edification. The civil power (the duke of
Württemberg was a Roman Catholic) was disposed to have
recourse to measures of repression, while the members of the
consistory, recognizing the good effects of such meetings, were
inclined to concede considerable liberty. Bengel exerted himself
on the side of the members of the consistory. In 1751 the
university of Tübingen conferred upon him the degree of doctor of
divinity. He died after a short illness, in 1752.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The works on which Bengel&rsquo;s reputation rests as a Biblical scholar
and critic are his edition of the Greek New Testament, and his
<i>Gnomon</i> or <i>Exegetical Commentary</i> on the same.</p>

<p>(A.) His edition of the Greek Testament was published at Tübingen
in 1734, and at Stuttgart in the same year, but without the critical
apparatus. So early as 1725, in an addition to his edition of Chrysostom&rsquo;s
<i>De Sacerdotio</i>, he had given an account in his <i>Prodromus
Novi Testamenti Graeci recte cauteque adornandi</i> of the principles on
which his intended edition was to be based. In preparation for his
work Bengel was able to avail himself of the collations of upwards of
twenty MSS., none of them, however, of great importance, twelve
of which had been collated by himself. In constituting the text, he
imposed upon himself the singular restriction of not inserting any
various reading which had not already been <i>printed</i> in some preceding
edition of the Greek text. From this rule, however, he deviated
in the case of the Apocalypse, where, owing to the corrupt state of
the text, he felt himself at liberty to introduce certain readings on
manuscript authority. In the lower margin of the page he inserted
a selection of various readings, the relative importance of which he
denoted by the first five letters of the Greek alphabet in the following
manner:&mdash;&alpha; was employed to denote the reading which in his judgment
was the true one, although he did not venture to place it in the
text; &beta;, a reading better than that in the text; &gamma;, one equal to the
textual reading; &delta; and &epsilon;, readings inferior to those in the text.
R. Étienne&rsquo;s division into verses was retained in the inner margin,
but the text was divided into paragraphs. The text was followed
by a critical apparatus, the first part of which consisted of an
introduction to the criticism of the New Testament, in the thirty-fourth
section of which he laid down and explained his celebrated canon,
&ldquo;<i>Proclivi scriptioni praestat ardua</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;The difficult reading is to be
preferred to that which is easy&rdquo;), the soundness of which, as a
general principle, has been recognized by succeeding critics. The
second part of the critical apparatus was devoted to a consideration
of the various readings, and here Bengel adopted the plan of stating
the evidence both <i>against</i> and <i>in favour</i> of a particular reading, thus
placing before the reader the materials for forming a judgment.
Bengel was the first definitely to propound the theory of families or
recensions of MSS. His investigations had led him to see that a
certain affinity or resemblance existed amongst many of the authorities
for the Greek text&mdash;MSS., versions, and ecclesiastical writers;
that if a peculiar reading, <i>e.g.</i>, was found in one of these, it was generally
found also in the other members of the same class; and this
general relationship seemed to point ultimately to a common origin
for all the authorities which presented such peculiarities. Although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page737" id="page737"></a>737</span>
disposed at first to divide the various documents into three classes,
he finally adopted a classification into two&mdash;the African or older
family of documents, and the Asiatic, or more recent class, to which
he attached only a subordinate value. The theory was afterwards
adopted by J.S. Semler and J.J. Griesbach, and worked up into an
elaborate system by the latter critic. Bengel&rsquo;s labours on the text
of the Greek Testament were received with great disfavour in many
quarters. Like Brian Walton and John Mill before him, he had to
encounter the opposition of those who believed that the certainty
of the word of God was endangered by the importance attached to
the various readings. J.J. Wetstein, on the other hand, accused
him of excessive caution in not making freer use of his critical
materials. In answer to these strictures, Bengel published a <i>Defence
of the Greek Text of His New Testament</i>, which he prefixed to his
<i>Harmony of the Four Gospels</i>, published in 1736, and which contained
a sufficient answer to the complaints, especially of Wetstein, which
had been made against him from so many different quarters.
The text of Bengel long enjoyed a high reputation among scholars,
and was frequently reprinted. An enlarged edition of the critical
apparatus was published by Philip David Burk in 1763.</p>

<p>(B.) The other great work of Bengel, and that on which his reputation
as an exegete is mainly based, is his <i>Gnomon Novi Testamenti,
or Exegetical Annotations on the New Testament</i>, published in
1742. It was the fruit of twenty years&rsquo; labour, and exhibits with a
brevity of expression, which, it has been said, &ldquo;condenses more
matter into a line than can be extracted from pages of other writers,&rdquo;
the results of his study. He modestly entitled his work a <i>Gnomon</i>
or index, his object being rather to guide the reader to ascertain
the meaning for himself, than to save him from the trouble of personal
investigation. The principles of interpretation on which he proceeded
were, to import nothing <i>into</i> Scripture, but to draw <i>out of</i> it
everything that it really contained, in conformity with grammatico-historical
rules; not to be hampered by dogmatical considerations;
and not to be influenced by the symbolical books. Bengel&rsquo;s hope
that the <i>Gnomon</i> would help to rekindle a fresh interest in the study
of the New Testament was fully realized. It has passed through
many editions, has been translated into German and into English,
and is still one of the books most valued by expositors of the New
Testament. John Wesley made great use of it in compiling his
<i>Expository Notes upon the New Testament</i> (1755).</p>

<p>Besides the two works already described, Bengel was the editor
or author of many others, classical, patristic, ecclesiastical and
expository. The more important are: <i>Ordo Temporum</i>, a treatise
on the chronology of Scripture, in which he enters upon speculations
regarding the end of the world, and an <i>Exposition of the Apocalypse</i>
which enjoyed for a time great popularity in Germany, and was
translated into several languages.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENGUELLA<a name="ar201" id="ar201"></a></span> (São Felipe de Benguella), a town of Portuguese
West Africa, capital of Benguella district, on a bay of the same
name, in 12° 33&prime; S., 13° 25&prime; E. Benguella was founded in 1617 by
the Portuguese under Manoel Cerveira Pereira. It was long the
centre of an important trade, especially in slaves to Brazil and
Cuba, but has now greatly declined. The anchorage, about a mile
from the town, in 4 to 6 fathoms, is nothing but an open roadstead.
Besides the churches of S. Felipe and S. Antonio, the
hospital, and the fortress, there are only a few stone-built houses.
The white population numbers about 1500. A short way beyond
Benguella is Bahia Tarta, where salt is manufactured and sulphur
excavated.</p>

<p>About 20 m. north of Benguella is Lobito Bay, a natural
harbour chosen (1903) as the starting-point of a railway to
Katanga. At Lobito steamers can come close inshore and
discharge cargo direct. Lobito is connected with Benguella by
a railway which passes about midway through Katumbella, a
town at the mouth of the river of the same name, and the sea
terminus of an ancient route from the heart of Central Africa
through Bihe. Old Benguella is a small town about 120 m. north
of Lobito Bay.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENÍ,<a name="ar202" id="ar202"></a></span> a river of Bolivia, a tributary of the Madeira, rising in
the elevated Cordilleras near the city of La Paz and at first known
as the Rio de La Paz, and flowing east, and north-east, to a
junction with the Mamoré at 10° 20&prime; S. lat. to form the Madeira.
Fully one-half of its length is through the mountainous districts
of central Bolivia, where it is fed by a large number of rivers and
streams from the snowclad peaks, and may be described as a
raging torrent. Below Reyes its course is through the forest-covered
hills and open plains of northern Bolivia, where some of
the old Indian missions were located. The lower river is navigable
for 217 m. from Reyes to the Esperanza rapids, 18 m. above
its confluence with the Mamoré, where a fall of 20 ft. in a distance
of 330 yds. obstructs free navigation. Its principal affluent is
the Madre de Dios, or Mayu-tata, which rises in the eastern
Cordilleras about 35 m. east of Cuzco, and flows in an east and
north-east direction through northern Bolivia to a junction with
the Bení 120 m. above its mouth. The principal tributaries of
the Madre de Dios are the Inambari and Paucartambo, both large
rivers, and the Chandless, Marcapata, and Tambopata. In
length and size of its tributaries the Madre de Dios is a more
important river than the Bení itself, and is navigable during the
wet season to the foot of the Andes, 180 m. from Cuzco.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENIN,<a name="ar206" id="ar206"></a></span> the name of a country, city and river of British West
Africa, west of the main channel of the Niger, forming part of the
protectorate of Southern Nigeria. The name was formerly applied
to the coast from the Volta, in 0° 40&prime; E., to the Rio del Rey, in 8°
40&prime; E., and included the Slave Coast, the whole delta of the Niger
and a small portion of the country to the eastward. Some trace
of this earlier application remains in the name &ldquo;Bight of Benin,&rdquo;
still given to that part of the sea which washes the Slave Coast,
whilst up to 1894 &ldquo;Benin&rdquo; was used to designate the French
possessions on the coast now included in Dahomey.</p>

<p>In its restricted sense Benin is the country formerly ruled by
the king of Benin city. This area, at one time very extensive,
gradually contracted as subject tribes and towns acquired
independence. It may be described as bounded W. by Lagos,
S. by the territory of the Jakri and other tribes of the Niger
delta, E. by the Niger river, and N. by Yorubaland. The
coast-line held by Benin had passed out of its sovereignty by the
middle of the 19th century. In physical characteristics, climate,
flora and fauna, Benin in no way differs from the rest of the
southern portion of Nigeria (<i>q.v.</i>). The coast is low, intersected
by creeks, and forms one huge mangrove swamp; on the rising
ground inland are dense forests in which the cotton and mahogany
trees are conspicuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page738" id="page738"></a>738</span></p>

<p>Benin river (known also as the Jakri outlet), though linked to
the Niger system by a network of creeks, is an independent stream.
It is formed by the junction of two rivers, the Ethiope and the
Jamieson, which rise (north of 6° N,) on the western side of the
hills which slope east to the Niger river. They unite about 50 m.
above the sea. The general course of the Benin is westerly. It
enters the Atlantic in about 5° 46&prime; N., 5° 3&prime; E., and at its mouth
is 2 m. wide. It is here obstructed by a sand-bar over which there
is 12-14 ft. of water at high tide. The river is navigable by small
steamers up to Sapele, a town on the south bank immediately
below the junction of the head streams. The Ologi and Gwato
creeks enter the Benin on the right or north bank, and on the
same side (8 m. above the mouth of the river) a channel, the Lagos
creek, 170 m. long, branches off to the north-west, affording a
waterway to Lagos. From the south or left bank of the Benin
the Forcados mouth of the Niger can be reached by the Nana
creek.</p>

<p>The Beni are a pure negro tribe, speaking a distinct language,
but having many characteristics common to those of the Yoruba-
and Ewe-speaking tribes. Like the Ashanti and Dahomeyans
the Beni had a well-organized and powerful government and
possessed a culture rare among negro races (see below, <i>History</i>).</p>

<p>Benin city is situated in a clearing of the forest, about 25 m.
from the river-port of Gwato, on Gwato creek. The principal
building is the British residency, which is constructed of brick
and timber. A primary school, supported by the native chiefs,
was opened in 1901, and a meteorological station was established
in 1902. In 1904 the town was placed in telegraphic communication
with the rest of the protectorate and with Europe. Of the
ancient city, whose buildings excited the admiration of travellers
in the 17th and 18th centuries, scarcely a trace remains. The
houses are neatly built of clay, coloured with red ochre, and
frequently ornamented with rudely carved pillars. The port of
Gwato, which lies about 30 m. north-north-east of the mouth of
the Benin river, has a special interest as the place where Giovanni
Belzoni, the explorer of Egyptian antiquities, died in 1823 when
starting on an expedition to Timbuktu. No trace of his grave can
now be found. Wari (formerly known also as Owari, Oywheré,
&amp;c.) is a much-frequented port on a branch of the Niger of the
same name reached from the Forcados mouth, and is 55 m. south
of Benin city.</p>

<p>Since the abolition of the slave trade the chief export of the
country is palm-oil. Other trade products were from time to
time&mdash;with the desire to preserve the isolation and independence
of the country&mdash;placed under fetish, <i>i.e.</i> their export was forbidden,
so that in 1897 the only article in which trade was allowed
by the king was palm-oil. After the British occupation, an
extensive trade developed in oil, kernels, timber, ivory, rubber,
&amp;c. In the rubber and timber industries great strides have been
made. The chiefs and people have shown considerable aptitude
in adapting themselves to the new order of things. Among the
articles prized by the Beni is coral, of which the chiefs wear great
quantities as ornaments.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Benin was discovered by the Portuguese about the
year 1485, and they carried on a brisk trade in slaves, who were
taken to Elmina and sold to the natives of the Gold Coast. At
that time and for more than two centuries afterwards, Benin
seems to have been one of the most powerful states of West
Africa. It was known to Europeans in the 17th century as the
Great Benin. The towns of Lagos and Badagry were both
founded by Benin colonists. Benin city was the seat of a
theocracy of priests, in whose hands the oba or king, nominally
supreme, appears to have often been a puppet. He was revered
by his subjects as a species of divinity, and seldom left the
enclosure surrounding the royal palace. The religion and
mythology of the Beni, like those of the Yorubas, are based on
spirit- and ancestor-worship (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Negro</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Africa</a></span>: <i>Ethnology</i>);
the chief spirit or juju was worshipped with human sacrifices to
an appalling extent, the Benin fetish being considered the most
powerful in all West Africa. The usual form of sacrifice was
crucifixion. Many chiefs, in no way politically dependent on
Benin, used to send annual presents to the juju. The Benin
people do not appear to have indulged in wanton cruelty, and it is
stated that they usually stupefied the victims before putting them
to death. The people were skilled in brass work; their carving
and design were alike excellent. Carved ivory objects abound,
and there are many evidences of the skill attained by native
artists, who perhaps owed something to their contact with the
Portuguese. The weaving of cloth was also carried on. The Beni
remained politically and socially almost unaffected by European
influence until the occupation of their country by the British in
1897, their connexion with the white men having previously been
almost confined to matters of trade. The Portuguese withdrew
from the coast in the 18th century, but one of the most striking
proofs of their commercial influence is the fact that a corrupt
Lusitanian dialect was spoken by the older natives up to the last
quarter of the 19th century. The first English expedition to
Benin was in 1553; after that time a considerable trade grew up
between England and that country, ivory, palm-oil and pepper
being the chief commodities exported from Benin. The Dutch
afterwards established factories and maintained them for a
considerable time, chiefly with a view to the slave trade. In
1788 Captain Landolphe founded a factory called Barodo, near
the native village of Obobi for the French Compagnie d&rsquo;Oywheré;
and it lasted till 1792, when it was destroyed by the English. In
1863 Sir Richard Burton, then British consul at Fernando Po,
went to Benin to try and put a stop to human sacrifices, an
attempt in which he did not succeed. At that time the decline
in power of the kingdom of Benin was obvious, and the city was
in a decaying condition. In 1885 the coast-line of Benin was
placed under British protection, and steps were taken to enter
into friendly relations with the king. Consul G.F.N.B.
Annesley<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> saw the king in 1890, with the hope of making a treaty,
but failed in his object. In March 1892 Captain H.L. Gallwey,
British vice-consul, succeeded in concluding a treaty with the
king Overami. The treaty, however, proved of no avail, and
the king kept as aloof as of old from any outside interference.
In January 1897 J.R. Phillips, acting consul-general, and eight
Europeans were brutally massacred on the road from Gwato to
Benin city, whilst on a mission to the king. Phillips had persisted
in starting for Benin despite the repeated request of the king
that he should delay his visit until he (the king) had finished the
celebration of the annual &ldquo;customs.&rdquo; Two Europeans, Captain
Alan Boisragon and R.F. Locke, alone escaped. A punitive
expedition was organized under the command of Admiral Sir
Harry Rawson, the success of which was a remarkable example
of good organization hastily improvised. The news of the
massacre of Phillips&rsquo;s party reached Rear-Admiral Rawson, the
commander-in-chief on the Cape station, on the 4th of January
1897. The flagship was at Simons Town. The small craft were
dispersed. Two ships at Malta had been ordered to join the Cape
command. A transport was chartered in the Thames for the
purposes of the expedition. In twenty-nine days a force of 1200
men, coming from three places between 3000 and 4500 m. from
the Benin river, was landed, organized, equipped and provided
with transport. Five days later the city of Benin was taken, and
in twelve days more the men were re-embarked, and the ships
coaled and ready for any further service. On the 17th of February
Benin was occupied after considerable fighting. The town, which
was found to be reeking of human sacrifices, was partly burned,
and on the 22nd the expedition started on its return. The king
and chiefs responsible for the massacre were placed on their trial
by Sir Ralph Moor, high commissioner for Southern Nigeria;
the king was deposed and deported to Calabar, and the chiefs, six
in all, were executed. The chief offender was not brought to
justice until a second punitive expedition in 1899 completed the
pacification of the country. After the removal of the king in
September 1897 a council of chiefs was appointed. This council
carries on the government of the whole Beni country, and is
presided over by a British resident.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BENJAMIN,<a name="ar208" id="ar208"></a></span> a tribe of Israel, named after the youngest son of
Jacob and Rachel. As distinct from the others Benjamin was
born not beyond the Jordan but in Palestine, between Bethel and
Ephrath. His mother, dying in childbed, gave him the name
Ben-oni, &ldquo;Son of my sorrow,&rdquo; which was changed by his father
to Ben-jamin, meaning probably &ldquo;Son of the right hand&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i>
&ldquo;of prosperity,&rdquo; or, perhaps, &ldquo;son of the south&rdquo;; Gen. xxxv.
16-18). Of his personal history little is recorded. He was the
favourite of his father and brothers (with which contrast the
spirit of the stories in Judg. xix.-xxi.), and the reputation of
fierceness ascribed to him in the blessing of Jacob (&ldquo;Benjamin
is a wolf that teareth,&rdquo; Gen. xlix. 27) agrees with what is told of
the tribe&rsquo;s warriors (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ehud</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Saul</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jonathan</a></span>). It is a curious
feature that its noted slingers were said to be left-handed (Judg.
xx. 16, cf. iii. 15) and even ambidextrous (1 Chron. xii. 2). The
late references to this tribe in the Israelite wanderings in the
wilderness are of little value. On entering Palestine it is allotted
a portion encompassed by the districts of Ephraim, Dan and
Judah. In the time of the &ldquo;judges&rdquo; the tribe of Benjamin was
almost exterminated (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Judges, Book of</a></span>), 600 men alone
escaping (Judges xix. sqq.). The tribe was built up again by the
rape of the maidens of Shiloh at one of their annual festivals
(for which cf. Judges ix. 27), but a later narrative gives currency
to a tradition that 400 virgins were also brought to Shiloh, the
survivors of a massacre of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead. At
all events, Benjamin claimed the honour of providing the great
king of Israel whose heroic deliverance of Jabesh-Gilead is
referred to elsewhere (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Saul</a></span>), and it is noteworthy that the
tribe only now attain historical importance. If the genealogies
associated it with Joseph the father of Ephraim and Manasseh,
its fortunes were for a time bound up with the northern kingdom
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">David</a></span>). Although its territory lies open on the west and
east, its physical features unite it to Judah, and what is known of
its mixed population<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a> makes it difficult to determine how far the
youngest of the tribes of Israel enjoyed any independent position
previous to the monarchy. Its neutral position between Judah
and Ephraim gave it an importance which was religious as well as
political. Anathoth the home of Abiathar and Jeremiah, Gibeon
the old Canaanite sanctuary, the royal sanctuary at Bethel, its
associations with Samuel and the prophetic gilds of the times
of Elijah and Elisha, and finally Jerusalem itself, the centre of
worship, give &ldquo;the least of all the tribes&rdquo; a unique value in the
history of Old Testament religion.</p>

work is of much value for the Jewish history of the 12th century.
It is from Benjamin that we know that the Jews of Palestine and
other parts of the East were noted for the arts of dyeing and
glass-making.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His <i>Itinerary</i> was translated from the Hebrew into Latin by Arias
Montanus in 1575, and appeared in a French version by Baratier
in 1734. There have been various English translations. One was
published by Asher in 1840; another (with critical Hebrew text) by
M.N. Adler (<i>Jewish Quarterly Review</i>, vols. xvi.-xviii.; also
reprinted as a separate volume, 1907).</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENJAMIN, JUDAH PHILIP<a name="ar210" id="ar210"></a></span> (1811-1884), Anglo-American
lawyer, of Jewish descent, was born a British subject at St Thomas
in the West Indies on the 11th of August 1811, and was successively
an American lawyer, a leading Confederate politician and
a distinguished English barrister. He eventually died in Paris a
domiciled Frenchman. After 1818 his parents lived in Charleston,
South Carolina, and he went to Yale in 1825 for his education, but
left without taking a degree, and entered an attorney&rsquo;s office in
New Orleans. He was admitted to the New Orleans bar in 1832.
He compiled with his friend John Slidell a valuable digest of
decisions of the superior courts of New Orleans and Louisiana;
and as a partner in the firm of Slidell, Benjamin &amp; Conrad, he
enjoyed a good practice. In 1848 he was admitted a councillor
of the supreme court, and in 1852 he was elected a senator for
Louisiana, and thereafter he took an active part in politics,
declining to accept a judgeship of the supreme court. In 1861 he
withdrew from the Senate, left Washington and actively espoused
the Confederate cause. He joined Jefferson Davis&rsquo;s provisional
government as attorney-general, becoming afterwards his
secretary for war (1861-1862), and chief secretary of state
(1862-1865). Although at times subject to fierce criticism with
regard to matters of administration and finance, he was recognized
as one of the ablest men on the Confederate side, and he
remained with Jefferson Davis to the last, sharing his flight after
the surrender at Appomattox, and only leaving him shortly before
his capture, because he found himself unable to go farther on
horseback. He escaped from the coast of Florida in an open boat,
and after many vicissitudes reached England, an exile. In 1866 his
remaining property was lost in the banking failure of Overend &amp; Gurney.</p>

<p>In London Benjamin was able to earn a little money by
journalism, and on the 13th of January 1866 he entered Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn. He received a hospitable welcome from the legal profession.
The influence of English judges who knew his abilities and his
circumstances enabled him to be called to the bar on the 6th of
June 1866, dispensing with the usual three years as a student,
and he acquired his first knowledge of the practice and methods
of English courts as the pupil of Mr C.E. (afterwards Baron)
Pollock. Pollock fully recognized his abilities and they became
and remained firm friends. Benjamin was naturally an apt and
useful pupil; for instance, an opinion of Mr Pollock, which for
long guided the London police in the exercise of their right to
search prisoners, is mentioned by him as having been really
composed by Benjamin while he was still his pupil. Benjamin
joined the northern circuit, and a large proportion of his early
practice came from solicitors at Liverpool who had correspondents
in New Orleans. His business gradually increased, and having
received a patent of precedence, he was on the 2nd of November
1872 called within the bar as a queen&rsquo;s counsel. In addition to
his knowledge of law and of commercial matters he had considerable
eloquence, and a power of marshalling facts and arguments
that rendered him extremely effective, particularly before judges.
He was less successful in addressing juries, and towards the close
of his career did not take <i>Nisi prius</i> work, but in the court of
appeal and House of Lords and before the judicial committee of
the privy council he enjoyed a very large practice, making for
some time fully £15,000 a year. The question of raising him to
the bench was seriously considered by Lord Cairns, who, however,
seems to have thought that the ungrudging hospitality and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page740" id="page740"></a>740</span>
goodwill with which Benjamin had been received by the English
legal profession had gone far enough. Towards the close of his
career he was in ill health, and he suffered from the results of a fall
from a tramcar. He retired in 1882 to a house in Paris which he
had built and where he had been in the habit of passing his vacations
with his wife, who was a Frenchwoman. He never returned
to practice, but came back to London to be entertained by the
bench and bar of England at a banquet in the Inner Temple Hall
on the 30th of June 1883. He died at Paris on the 6th of May
1884.</p>

<p>Benjamin was thick-set and stout, with an expression of great
shrewdness. An early portrait of him is to be found in Jefferson
Davis&rsquo;s <i>Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government</i>. His political
history may be traced in that work, and in John W. Draper&rsquo;s
<i>American Civil War</i> and von Holst&rsquo;s <i>Constitutional History of
the United States</i>. Many allusions to his English career will be
found in works describing English lawyers of his period, and there
are some interesting reminiscences of him by Baron Pollock in the
<i>Fortnightly Review</i> for March 1898. His <i>Treatise on the Law of
Sale of Personal Property with References to the American Decisions
and to the French Code and Civil Law</i>&mdash;a bulky volume known to
practitioners as <i>Benjamin on Sales</i>&mdash;is the principal text-book
on its subject, and a fitting monument of the author&rsquo;s career at
the English bar, of his industry and learning. Many of his
American speeches have been published.</p>

Callander. It is situated close to some of the most romantic
scenery in the Highlands, and is particularly well known through
Scott&rsquo;s <i>Lady of the Lake</i>. Its name is supposed to point to the
time when Beltane rites were observed on its summit. A cairn
was built on the top in 1887 to commemorate Queen Victoria&rsquo;s
jubilee. On one of the sides of the mountain is a tarn which
bears the name of Lochan nan Corp, &ldquo;the little loch of the dead,&rdquo;

about 9 m. from the head and about 15 from the foot. It is
3192 ft. high, and the prevailing rocks are granite, mica schist,
diorite, porphyry and quartzite, the last, where it crops out on
the surface, gleaming in the distance like snow. Duchray Water,
a head-stream of the Forth, rises in the north-east shoulder. The
hill, which is covered with grass to the top, is a favourite climb,
being ascended from Rowardennan (the easiest) or Inversnaid
on the lake, or Aberfoyle 10 m. inland due east. The view from
the summit extends northward as far as the Grampians, with
occasional glimpses of Ben Nevis; westward to Jura in the

<p><span class="bold">BENLOWES, EDWARD<a name="ar214" id="ar214"></a></span> (1603?-1676), English poet, son of
Andrew Benlowes of Brent Hall, Essex, was born about 1603.
He matriculated at St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, in 1620, and
on leaving the university he made a prolonged tour on the
continent of Europe. He was a Roman Catholic in middle life,
but became a convert to Protestantism in his later years. He
dissipated his fortune by openhanded generosity to his friends
and relations, and possibly by serving in the Civil War; so that
he was in great poverty at the time of his death, which occurred
on the 18th of December 1676. The last eight years of his life
were passed at Oxford. Many of his writings are in Latin. His
most important work is <i>Theophila, or Love&rsquo;s Sacrifice, a Divine
Poem</i> (1652). The poem deals with mystical religion, telling
how the soul, represented by Theophila, ascends by humility,
zeal and contemplation, and triumphs over the sins of the senses.
It is written in a curious stanza of three lines of unequal length
rhyming together. Until recent times justice has hardly been
done to Benlowes&rsquo; poetical merits and indisputable piety. Samuel
Butler, who satirized him in his &ldquo;Character of a Small Poet,&rdquo;
found abundant matter for ridicule in his eccentricities; and
Pope and Warburton noted him as a patron of bad poets.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>His <i>Theophila</i> was reprinted by S.W. Singer; and in <i>Minor Poets
of the Caroline Period</i>, vol. i. (1905), Mr Saintsbury reprints <i>Theophila</i>

&ldquo;the mountain of the black pig,&rdquo; in allusion to its shape), the
second highest mountain (4296 ft.) in Great Britain, one of the
Cairngorm group, on the confines of south-western Aberdeenshire
and south-western Banffshire, not far from the eastern boundary
of Inverness-shire. It is about 11 m. from Castleton of Braemar
and about 10 from Aviemore. The ascent is usually made from
Castleton of Braemar, by way of the Linn of Dee, Glen Lui and
Glen Derry. From the head of Glen Derry, with its blasted
trees, the picture of desolation, it becomes more toilsome, but is
partly repaid by the view of the remarkable columnar cliffs of
Corrie Etchachan. The summit is flat and quite bare of vegetation,
but the panorama in every direction is extremely grand.
At the foot of a vast gully, 2500 ft. above the sea, lies Loch Avon
(or A&rsquo;an), a narrow lake about 1½ m. long, with water of the
deepest blue and a margin of bright yellow sand. At the western
end of the lake is the Shelter Stone, an enormous block of granite
resting upon two other blocks, which can accommodate a dozen
persons. Beautiful rock crystals occur in veins in the corries.
The summit of Cairngorm, 3½ m. north of that of Ben Macdhui,
may be reached from the latter with scarcely any descent, by
following the rugged ridge flanking the western side of Loch Avon.
The other great peaks of the group are Braeriach (4248 ft.) and
Cairntoul (4241 ft.), and 6 m. to the east are the twin masses of
Ben a Bourd, the northern top of which is 3924 ft. and the southern
3860 ft. high. Ben A&rsquo;an, an adjoining hill, is 3843 ft. high.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENNETT, CHARLES EDWIN<a name="ar216" id="ar216"></a></span> (1858-&emsp;&emsp;), American
classical scholar, was born on the 6th of April 1858, in
Providence, Rhode Island. He graduated from Brown University
in 1878 and also studied at Harvard (1881-1882) and in
Germany (1882-1884). He taught in secondary schools in
Florida (1878-1879), New York (1879-1881), and Nebraska
(1885-1889), and became professor of Latin in the University
of Wisconsin in 1889, of classical philology at Brown University
in 1891, and of Latin at Cornell University in 1892. His syntactical
studies, notably various papers on the subjunctive, are
based on a statistical examination of Latin texts and are marked
by a fresh system of nomenclature; he ranks as one of the leaders
of the &ldquo;New American School&rdquo; of syntacticians, who insist
on a preliminary re-examination of all available data. Of great
importance are his advocacy of &ldquo;quantitative&rdquo; reading of Latin
verse and his <i>Critique of Some Recent Subjunctive Theories</i> in
vol. ix. (1898) of <i>Cornell Studies in Classical Philology</i>, of which
he was an editor. Bennett&rsquo;s <i>Latin Grammar</i> (1895) is the first
successful attempt in America to adopt the method of the brief,
scholarly <i>Schulgrammatik</i>. Besides the Latin classics commonly
read in secondary courses and other text-books in &ldquo;Bennett&rsquo;s
Latin Series,&rdquo; he edited Tacitus&rsquo;s <i>Dialogus de Oratoribus</i> (1894),
and Cicero&rsquo;s <i>De Senectute</i> (1897) and <i>De Amicitia</i> (1897). He
wrote, with George P. Bristol, <i>The Teaching of Greek and Latin

<p><span class="bold">BENNETT, JAMES GORDON<a name="ar217" id="ar217"></a></span> (1794-1872), American journalist,
founder and editor of the New York Herald, was born at
Newmills in Banffshire, Scotland, in 1794 (not in 1800, as has been
stated). He was educated for the Roman Catholic priesthood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page741" id="page741"></a>741</span>
in a seminary at Aberdeen, but in the spring of 1819, giving up
the career which had been chosen for him, he emigrated to
America. Landing at Halifax, Nova Scotia, he earned a poor
living there for a short time by giving lessons in French, Spanish
and bookkeeping; he passed next to Boston, where starvation
threatened him until he got employment in a printing-office;
and in 1822 he went to New York. An engagement as translator
of Spanish for the <i>Courier</i> of Charleston, South Carolina, took
him there for a few months in 1823. On his return to New York
he projected a school, gave lectures on political economy and did
subordinate work for the journals. During the next ten years
he was employed on various papers, was the Washington correspondent
first of the <i>New York Enquirer</i>, and later of the <i>Courier
and Enquirer</i> in 1827-1832, his letters attracting much attention;
he founded the short-lived <i>Globe</i> in New York in 1832; and in
1833-1834 was the chief editor and one of the proprietors of the
<i>Pennsylvanian</i> at Philadelphia. On the 6th of May 1835 he
published the first number of a small one-cent paper, bearing
the title of <i>New York Herald</i>, and issuing from a cellar, in which
the proprietor and editor played also the part of salesman.
&ldquo;He started with a disclaimer of all principle, as it is called, all
party, all politics&rdquo;; and to this he consistently adhered. By
his industry, sagacity and unscrupulousness, and by the variety
of his news, the &ldquo;spicy&rdquo; correspondence, and the supply of
personal gossip and scandal, he made the paper a great commercial
success. He devoted his attention particularly to the gathering
of news, and was the first to introduce many of the methods
of the modern American reporter. He published on the 13th
of June 1835, the first Wall Street financial article to appear in
any American newspaper; printed a vivid and detailed account
of the great fire of December 1835, in New York; was the first,
in 1846, to obtain the report in full by telegraph of a long political
speech; and during the Civil War maintained a staff of sixty-three
war correspondents. Bennett continued to edit the
Herald almost till his death, at New York, on the 1st of
June 1872.</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">James Gordon Bennett</span> (1841-&emsp;&emsp;), took over the
management of the paper during the last year of its founder&rsquo;s
life, and succeeded him in its control. It was he who sent
Henry M. Stanley on his mission to find Livingstone in Central
Africa, and he fitted out the &ldquo;Jeannette&rdquo; Polar Expedition, and
in 1883 established (with John W. Mackay) the Commercial
Cable Company.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENNETT, JOHN HUGHES<a name="ar219" id="ar219"></a></span> (1812-1875), English physician
and pathologist, was born in London on the 31st of August 1812.
He was educated at Exeter, and being destined for the medical
profession was articled to a surgeon in Maidstone. In 1833 he
began his studies at Edinburgh, and in 1837 graduated with the
highest honours. During the next four years he studied in Paris
and Germany, and on his return to Edinburgh in 1841 published
a <i>Treatise on Cod-liver Oil as a Therapeutic Agent</i>. In the same
year he began to lecture as an extra-academical teacher on
histology, drawing attention to the importance of the microscope
in the investigation of disease; and as physician to the Royal
Dispensary he instituted courses of &ldquo;polyclinical medicine.&rdquo;
In 1843 he was appointed professor of the institutes of medicine
at Edinburgh, and performed the duties of that chair with great
energy till incapacitated by failing health. He resigned in 1874.
In August 1875 he was able to be present at the meeting of the
British Medical Association in Edinburgh, on which occasion he
received the degree of LL.D., but the fatigue he then underwent
brought on a relapse, and he was compelled to have the operation
of lithotomy performed. He sank rapidly and died on the 25th
of September at Norwich. His publications were very numerous
including <i>Lectures on Clinical Medicine</i> (1850-1856), which in
second and subsequent editions were called <i>Clinical Lectures
on the Principles and Practice of Medicine</i>, and were translated
into various languages, including Russian and Hindu; <i>Leucocythaemia</i>
(1852), the first recorded cure of which was published
by him in 1845; <i>Outlines of Physiology</i> (1858), reprinted from
the 8th edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>; <i>Pathology and
Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</i> (1853); <i>Textbook of
Physiology</i> (1871-1872).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BENNETT, SIR WILLIAM STERNDALE<a name="ar220" id="ar220"></a></span> (1816-1875), English
musical composer, the son of Robert Bennett, an organist, was
born at Sheffield on the 13th of April 1816. Having lost his
father at an early age, he was brought up at Cambridge by his
grandfather, from whom he received his first musical education.
He entered the choir of King&rsquo;s College chapel in 1824. In 1826
he entered the Royal Academy of Music, and remained a pupil of
that institution for the next ten years, studying pianoforte under
W.H. Holmes and Cipriani Potter, and composition under Lucas
and Dr Crotch. It was during this time that he wrote several of
his most appreciated works, in which may be traced influences
of the contemporary movement of music in Germany, which
country he frequently visited during the years 1836-1842. At
one of the Rhenish musical festivals in Düsseldorf he made the
personal acquaintance of Mendelssohn, and soon afterwards
renewed it at Leipzig, where the talented young Englishman was
welcomed by the leading musicians of the rising generation. At
one of the celebrated Gewandhaus concerts he played his third
pianoforte concerto, which was received enthusiastically. An enthusiastic
account of the event was written by Robert Schumann,
who pronounced Bennett to be the most &ldquo;<i>musikalisch</i>&rdquo; of all
Englishmen, and &ldquo;an angel of a musician&rdquo; (copying Gregory&rsquo;s
pun on <i>Angli</i> and <i>Angeli</i>). But it was Mendelssohn&rsquo;s influence
that dominated Bennett&rsquo;s mode of utterance. A good example
of this may be studied in Bennett&rsquo;s <i>Capriccio in D minor</i>. His
great success on the continent established his position on his
return to England. In 1834 he was elected organist of St Anne&rsquo;s
chapel (now church), Wandsworth. In this year he composed
his <i>Overture to Parisina</i>, and his Concerto in C minor, modelled
on Mozart. An unpublished concerto in F minor, and the
overture to the <i>Naiads</i>, impressed the firm of Broadwood so
favourably in 1836 that they offered the composer a year in
Leipzig, where the <i>Naiads</i> overture was performed at a Gewandhaus
concert on the 13th of February 1837. Bennett visited
Leipzig a second time in 1840-1841, when he composed his
<i>Caprice in E</i> for pianoforte and orchestra and his overture <i>The
Wood Nymphs</i>. He settled in London, devoting himself chiefly
to practical teaching. In 1844 he married Mary Anne, daughter
of Captain James Wood, R.N. He was made musical professor
at Cambridge in 1856, the year in which he was engaged as
permanent conductor of the Philharmonic Society. This latter
post he held until 1866, when he became principal of the Royal
Academy of Music. Owing to his professional duties his latter
years were not fertile, and what he then wrote was scarcely equal
to the productions of his youth. The principal charm of Bennett&rsquo;s
compositions (not to mention his absolute mastery of the musical
form) consists in the tenderness of their conception, rising
occasionally to sweetest lyrical intensity. Except the opera,
Bennett tried his hand at almost all the different forms of vocal
and instrumental writing. As his best works in various branches
of art, we may mention, for pianoforte solo, and with accompaniment
of the orchestra, his three sketches, <i>The Lake, The Millstream</i>
and <i>The Fountain</i>, and his 3rd pianoforte concerto; for
the orchestra, his <i>Symphony in G minor</i>, and his overture <i>The
Naiads</i>; and for voices, his cantata <i>The May Queen</i>, written for
the Leeds Festival in 1858. For the jubilee of the Philharmonic
Society he wrote the overture <i>Paradise and the Peri</i> in 1862. He
also wrote a sacred cantata, <i>The Woman of Samaria</i>, first performed
at the Birmingham Musical Festival in 1867. In 1870
the university of Oxford conferred upon him the honorary degree
of D.C.L. A year later he was knighted, and in 1872 he received
a public testimonial before a large audience at St James&rsquo;s Hall, the
money subscribed being devoted to the foundation of a scholarship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page742" id="page742"></a>742</span>
at the Royal Academy of Music. Shortly before his death he
produced a sonata called the <i>Maid of Orleans</i>, an elaborate piece
of programme music based on Schiller&rsquo;s tragedy. He died at his
house in St John&rsquo;s Wood, London, on the 15th of February 1875.

<p><span class="bold">BEN NEVIS,<a name="ar221" id="ar221"></a></span> the highest mountain in the British Isles, in
Inverness-shire, Scotland. It is 4406 ft. above the level of the sea,
and is situated 4½ m. E.S.E. of Fort William, the meridian of 5° W
passing through it. As viewed from Banavie on the Caledonian
Canal, it has the appearance of two great masses, one higher
than the other, and though its bulk is impressive, its outline is
much less striking than that of many other Highland hills. Its
summit consists of a plateau 100 acres in area, with a slight slope
to the south, terminating on its north-eastern side in a sheer fall
of more than 1500 ft. Snow lies in some of the gorges all the year
round. The rocks of its lower half are mainly granite and gneiss;
its upper half is composed of porphyritic greenstone, and a variety
of minerals occur. Its circumference at the base is about 30 m.
It may be described as flanked on the west and south by the Glen
and Water of Nevis, on the east by the river and Glen of Treig,
and on the north by the river and Glen of Spean. From 1881 till
1904 meteorological observations were taken from the summit of
Ben Nevis, the observers at first making the ascent daily for the
purpose. In 1883, however, an observatory, equipped at a cost
of £4000 (raised by public subscription), was opened by Mrs
Cameron Campbell of Monzie, who provided the site. The
observatory, which was connected by wire with the post office at
Fort William, was provisioned by the Scottish Meteorological
Society, to whom it belonged. The burden of maintaining it,
however, proving too great for the society&rsquo;s means, appeal was
made in vain to government for national support, and the station
was closed in 1904. The bridle road up the mountain leaves Glen
Nevis at Achintee; it has a gradient nowhere exceeding 1 in 5,
and the ascent is commonly effected in two to three hours.
There is a small hotel on the summit for the convenience of
tourists, especially of those anxious to witness sunrise. From
the summit every considerable peak in Scotland is visible.
Observations conducted during several months have shown that,
whilst the mean temperature at Fort William was 57° F., at the
summit of Ben Nevis it was 41° F., and that though the rainfall
at the fort amounted to 24 in., it was as much as 43 in. on the top
of the Ben.</p>

retired from the Hanoverian army in 1764, and in 1773 entered
the Russian service as a field officer. He fought against the
Turks in 1774 and in 1778, becoming lieutenant-colonel in the

Persian War of 1796. The part played by Bennigsen in the actual
assassination of the tsar Paul I. is not fully known, but he took a
most active share in the formation and conduct of the conspiracy.
Alexander I. made him governor-general of Lithuania in 1801,
and in 1802 a general of cavalry. In 1806 he was in command of
one of the Russian armies operating against Napoleon, when he
fought the battle of Pultusk and met the emperor in person in
the sanguinary battle of Eylau (8th of February 1807). Here he
could claim to have inflicted the first reverse suffered by Napoleon,
but six months later Bennigsen met with the crushing defeat of
Friedland (14th of June 1807) the direct consequence of which
was the treaty of Tilsit. Bennigsen now retired for some years,
but in the campaign of 1812 he reappeared in the army in various
responsible positions. He was present at Borodino, and defeated
Murat in the engagement of Tarutino, but on account of a quarrel
with Marshal Kutusov, the Russian commander-in-chief, he
was compelled to retire from active military employment. After
the death of Kutusov he was recalled and placed at the head of an
army. Bennigsen led one of the columns which made the decisive
attack on the last day of the battle of Leipzig (16th-19th of
October 1813). On the same evening he was made a count by
the emperor Alexander I., and he afterwards commanded the
forces which operated against Marshal Davout in North Germany.
After the general peace he held a command from 1815 to 1818,
when he retired from active service and settled on his Hanoverian
estate of Banteln near Hildesheim. Count Bennigsen died on the
3rd of December 1826. His son, <span class="sc">Alexander Levin</span>, count von
Bennigsen (1809-1893), was a distinguished Hanoverian statesman.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BENNIGSEN, RUDOLF VON<a name="ar223" id="ar223"></a></span> (1824-1902), German politician,
was born at Lüneburg on the 10th of July 1824. He was
descended from an old Hanoverian family, his father, Karl von
Bennigsen, being an officer in the Hanoverian army, who rose
to the rank of general and also held diplomatic appointments.
Bennigsen, having studied at the university of Göttingen,
entered the Hanoverian civil service. In 1855 he was elected a
member of the second chamber; and as the government refused
to allow him leave of absence from his official duties he resigned
his post in the public service. He at once became the recognized
leader of the Liberal opposition to the reactionary government,
but must be distinguished from Count Bennigsen, a member of
the same family, and son of the distinguished Russian general,
who was also one of the parliamentary leaders at the time.
What gave Bennigsen his importance not only in Hanover, but
throughout the whole of Germany, was the foundation of the
National Verein, which was due to him, and of which he was
president. This society, which arose out of the public excitement
created by the war between France and Austria, had for
its object the formation of a national party which should strive
for the unity and the constitutional liberty of the whole
Fatherland. It united the moderate Liberals throughout Germany, and
at once became a great political power, notwithstanding all the
efforts of the governments, and especially of the king of Hanover
to suppress it. In 1866 Bennigsen used all his influence to keep
Hanover neutral in the conflict between Prussia and Austria, but
in vain. He took no part in the war, but his brother, who was
an officer in the Prussian army, was killed in Bohemia. In May
of this year he had an important interview with Bismarck, who
wished to secure his support for the reform of the confederation,
and after the war was over at once accepted the position of a
Prussian subject, and took his seat in the diet of the North
German Confederation and in the Prussian parliament. He
used his influence to procure as much autonomy as possible for
the province of Hanover, but was a strong opponent of the
Guelph party. He was one of the three Hanoverians, Windthorst
and Miquel being the other two, who at once won for the
representatives of the conquered province the lead in both the
Prussian and German parliaments. The National Verein, its
work being done, was now dissolved; but Bennigsen was chiefly
instrumental in founding a new political party&mdash;the National
Liberals,&mdash;who, while they supported Bismarck&rsquo;s national policy,
hoped to secure the constitutional development of the country.
For the next thirty years he was president of the party, and was
the most influential of the parliamentary leaders. It was chiefly
owing to him that the building up of the internal institutions of
the empire was carried on without the open breach between
Bismarck and the parliament, which was often imminent. Many
amendments suggested by him were introduced in the debates
on the constitution; in 1870 he undertook a mission to South
Germany to strengthen the national party there, and was consulted
by Bismarck while at Versailles. It was he who brought
about the compromise on the military bill in 1874. In 1877 he
was offered the post of vice-chancellor with a seat in the Prussian
ministry, but refused it because Bismarck or the king would not
agree to his conditions. From this time his relations with the
government were less friendly, and in 1878 he brought about
the rejection of the first Socialist Bill. In 1883 he resigned his
seat in parliament owing to the reactionary measures of the
government, which made it impossible for him to continue his
former co-operation with Bismarck, but returned in 1887 to
support the coalition of national parties. One of the first acts
of the emperor William II. was to appoint him president of the
province of Hanover. In 1897 he resigned this post and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page743" id="page743"></a>743</span>
retired from public life. He died on the 7th of August
1902.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENNINGTON,<a name="ar224" id="ar224"></a></span> a village and one of the county-seats of
Bennington county, Vermont, U.S.A., situated in the S.W.
part of the state, about 30 m. E.N.E. of Troy, New York. Pop.
(1890) 3971; (1900) 5656 (965 foreign-born); (1910) 6211.
The township of the same name, in which it is situated, had in
1910 a population of 8698, living chiefly in the villages of
Bennington, North Bennington and Bennington Centre, the
last a summer resort. The village of Bennington is served by
the Rutland railway, and is connected by electric railway with
North Adams and Pittsfield, Mass., and Hoosick Falls, N.Y.
It is picturesquely situated at the foot of the Green Mountains,
and the summit of the neighbouring Mt. Anthony (2345 ft.)
commands a magnificent view. The village has woollen mills,
knitting mills, stereoscope, box, and collar and cuff factories
and machine shops. There are white clay and yellow ochre
works in different parts of the township. Bennington is the seat
of the Vermont state soldiers&rsquo; home. The Bennington Battle
Monument, a shaft 301 ft. high, is said to be the highest battle
monument in the world. It commemorates the success gained
on the 16th of August 1777 by a force of nearly 2000 &ldquo;Green
Mountain Boys&rdquo; and New Hampshire and Massachusetts
militia under General John Stark over two detachments of
General Burgoyne&rsquo;s army, totalling about 1200 men, under
Col. Friedrich Baum and Col. Breyman. These came up one
after the other in search of provisions and were practically
annihilated, Col. Baum being mortally wounded and 700 men
taken prisoners. The scene of the battle is about 5 m. from the
village. The victory had an important influence on Burgoyne&rsquo;s
campaign (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">American War of Independence</a></span>), weakening
Burgoyne and encouraging the American militia to take the
field against him. Bennington was settled in 1761 and was
named in honour of Governor Benning Wentworth of New
Hampshire. The township was organized in 1762. It was one
of the &ldquo;New Hampshire Grant&rdquo; towns, both New York and
New Hampshire claiming jurisdiction over it, and, being the
home of Ethan Alien and Seth Warner, it became the centre
of activities of the &ldquo;Green Mountain Boys,&rdquo; of whom they were
leaders. During the fifteen years in which Vermont was an
independent commonwealth, Bennington was the headquarters
of the council of safety. In 1828-1829 W.L. Garrison edited
here a paper called <i>The Journal of the Times</i>. The village of
Bennington was incorporated in 1849.</p>

count of Woldenburg, was educated at Gosslar, and in 1066 was
nominated by the emperor Henry IV. to the see of Meissen. In
the troubles between empire and papacy that followed Benno
took part against the emperor. In 1085 he was deposed by the
synod of Mainz, but after the death of Pope Gregory VII. he
submitted, and on the recommendation of the imperialist Pope
Clement III. was restored to his see, which he held till his death.
He did much for his diocese, both by ecclesiastical reforms on
the Hildebrandine model and by material developments. He
was long reverenced in his own diocese as a saint before, in 1523,
he was canonized by Pope Adrian VI. His canonization drew
from Luther a violent brochure &ldquo;against the new false god and
old devil, who is to be lifted up at Meissen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENOIT, PETER LEONARD LEOPOLD<a name="ar226" id="ar226"></a></span> (1834-1901), Flemish
composer, was born on the 17th of August 1834 at Harlebeke
in Flanders. His father and a local village organist were his
first teachers. In 1851 Benoit entered the Brussels Conservatoire,
where he remained till 1855, studying chiefly under F.J.
Fétis. During this period he composed music to many melodramas,
and to an opera <i>Le Village dans les montagnes</i> for the
Park theatre, of which in 1856 he became conductor. He won
a government prize and a money grant in 1857 by his cantata
<i>Le Meurtre d&rsquo;Abel</i>, and this enabled him to travel through
Germany. In course of his journeyings he found time to write
a considerable amount of music, as well as an essay <i>L&rsquo;École de
musique flamande et son avenir</i>. Fétis loudly praised his
<i>Messe solennelle</i>, which Benoit produced at Brussels on his
return from Germany. In 1861 he visited Paris for the production
of his opera <i>Le Roi des Aulnes</i> (&ldquo;Erlkönig&rdquo;), which, though
accepted by the Théâtre Lyrique, was never mounted; while
there he conducted at the Bouffes-Parisiens. Again returning
home, he astonished a section of the musical world by the production
at Antwerp of a sacred tetralogy, consisting of his
<i>Cantate de Noël</i>, the above-mentioned <i>Mass</i>, a <i>Te Deum</i> and a
<i>Requiem</i>, in which were embodied to a large extent his theories
of Flemish music. It was in consequence of his passion for the
founding of an entirely separate Flemish school that Benoit
changed his name from Pierre to Peter. By prodigious efforts
he succeeded in gathering round him a small band of enthusiasts,
who affected to see with him possibilities in the foundation of
a school whose music should differ completely from that of the
French and German schools. In its main features this school
failed, for its faith was pinned to Benoit&rsquo;s music, which is hardly
more Flemish than French or German. Benoit&rsquo;s more important
compositions include the Flemish oratorios <i>De Schelde</i> and
<i>Lucifer</i>, the latter of which met with complete failure on its
production in London in 1888; the operas <i>Het Dorp int Gebirgte</i>
and <i>Isa</i>, the <i>Drama Christi</i>; an enormous mass of songs, choruses,
small cantatas and motets. Benoit also wrote a great number
of essays on musical matters. He died at Antwerp on the 8th
of March 1901.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENOÎT DE SAINTE-MORE,<a name="ar227" id="ar227"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Sainte-Maure</span>, 12th century
French <i>trouvère</i>, is supposed to have been a native of Sainte-Maure
in Touraine. Very little is known of his personal history.
The <i>maître</i> prefixed to his name implies that he had graduated
at the university, but there is nothing to show whether he was
a simple <i>trouvère</i> by profession or belonged to the clergy. He
was a loyal subject of Henry II. of England, to whose court he
was attached, and when he speaks of the French, it is as &ldquo;they.&rdquo;
Wace had begun a history of the dukes of Normandy in his
<i>Roman du Rou</i>. This he brought down to the reign of Henry I.,
but here Henry II. seems to have withdrawn his patronage, and
at the end of his poem Wace refers to a <i>maistre Beneeit</i> who had
received a similar commission. There is no other contemporary
poem extant dealing with the subject except the <i>Chronique des
ducs de Normandie</i>, and it would seem reasonable to assume the
identity of Wace&rsquo;s rival with Benoît de Sainte-More, whose
authorship of the chronicle has, nevertheless, been often disputed.
But a comparison of the <i>Roman de Troie</i>, which is certainly
Benoît&rsquo;s work, with the <i>Chronique</i>, confirms the supposition that
they are by the same author. The poem contains over forty
thousand lines, and relates the history of the Norman dukes
from Rollo to Henry I., with a preliminary sketch of the Danish
invasions and the adventures of Hastings and his companions.
It has no claims to be considered an original authority. Benoît
drew his information from the <i>De moribus et actis primorum
Normanniae ducum</i> of Dudon de Saint Quentin as far as 1002,
following his model very closely. From that time he avails
himself of the chronicle of William of Jumieges, also of Ordericus
Vitalis and others. The <i>Chronique</i> probably dates from about
1172 to 1176. In the <i>Roman de Troie</i>, written about 1160,
Benoît expressly asserts his authorship. He mentions &ldquo;Omers&rdquo;
with great respect as <i>li clers merveillos</i>, but his authority for the
story is naturally not Homer, of whom he could have no first-hand
knowledge. He follows the apocryphal <i>Historia de excidio
Trojae</i> of Dares the Phrygian and the <i>Ephemerides belli Trojani</i>
of Dictys of Crete. The poem runs to about 30,000 lines. The
personages of the classical story are converted into heroes of
romance. They have their castles and their abbeys, and act
in accordance with feudal custom. The supernatural machinery
of Homer is missing both in Benoît&rsquo;s original and his own
narrative. The story begins with the capture of the Golden
Fleece and comes down to the return of the Greek princes after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page744" id="page744"></a>744</span>
the fall of Troy. Benoît diverges very widely from the classical
tradition, and M. Léopold Constans sees reason to suppose that
the <i>trouvère</i> founded his poem on an amplified version of the
Dares narrative that has not come down to us. In the <i>Roman
de Troie</i> first appeared the episode of Troïlus and Briseïde, that
was to be developed later in the <i>Filostrato</i> of Boccaccio, which
in its turn formed the basis of Chaucer&rsquo;s <i>Troilus and Creseide</i>.
The Shakespearian play of <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> is also indirectly
derived from Benoît&rsquo;s story.</p>

<p>On the strength of a certain similarity of treatment Benoît has
sometimes been credited with the authorship of the anonymous
<i>Roman d&rsquo;Énéas</i> and of the <i>Roman de Thèbes</i>, a romance derived
indirectly from the <i>Thebaïs</i> of Statius. M. Constans is inclined
to negative both these attributions. It is not even certain that
the Benoît who chronicled the deeds of the Norman dukes for
Henry II. between 1172 and 1176 was the Benoît de Sainte-More
of the <i>Roman de Troie</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENSERADE, ISAAC DE<a name="ar228" id="ar228"></a></span> (1613-1691), French poet, was born
in Paris, and baptized on the 5th of November 1613. His family
appears to have been connected with Richelieu, who bestowed on
him a pension of 600 livres. He began his literary career with the
tragedy of <i>Cléopâtre</i> (1635), which was followed by four other indifferent pieces. On Richelieu&rsquo;s death Benserade lost his pension,
but became more and more a favourite at court, especially
with Anne of Austria. He provided the words for the court
ballets, and was, in 1674, admitted to the Academy, where he
wielded an influence quite out of proportion to the merit of his
work. In 1676 the failure of his <i>Métamorphoses d&rsquo;Ovide</i> in the
form of rondeaux gave a blow to his reputation, but by no means
destroyed his vogue with his contemporaries. Benserade would
probably be forgotten but for his sonnet on Job (1651). This
sonnet, which he sent to a young lady with his paraphrase on Job,
having been placed in competition with the <i>Urania</i> of Voiture, a
dispute on their relative merits long divided the whole court and
the wits into two parties, styled respectively the <i>Jobelins</i> and the
<i>Uranists</i>. The partisans of Benserade were headed by the prince
de Conti and Mile de Scudéry, while Mme de Montausier and
J.G. de Balzac took the side of Voiture.</p>

<p>Some years before his death, on the 19th of October 1691,
Benserade retired to Chantilly, and devoted himself to a translation
of the Psalms, which he nearly completed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENSLEY, ROBERT,<a name="ar229" id="ar229"></a></span> an 18th-century English actor, of whom
Charles Lamb in the <i>Essays of Elia</i> speaks with special praise.
His early life is obscure, and he is said to have served in America
as a lieutenant of marines; but he appeared at Drury Lane in
1765, and at that house and at Covent Garden, and later at the
Haymarket, he played important parts up to 1796, when he
retired from the stage. He appears then to have been given
a small post under the government, a paymastership, which he
resigned in 1798. He is stated in various quarters to have died
in 1817, but Mr Joseph Knight shows in his article in the <i>Dict.
Nat. Biog.</i> that this is due to a confusion with another man
named William Bensley, who possibly belonged to the family
of printers of whom Thomas Bensley (d. 1833) was the chief
representative. On the stage he was simply &ldquo;Mr Bensley,&rdquo;
but though he is named William and even Richard in some
accounts, Mr Knight shows that his name was certainly Robert.
The actual date of his death is unknown, though it was probably
later than 1809, when he is said to have inherited a fortune. His
great character was Malvolio, but Charles Lamb&rsquo;s fervent
admiration of his acting seems to have outrun the general
opinion.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">BENSON, EDWARD WHITE<a name="ar230" id="ar230"></a></span> (1829-1896), archbishop of
Canterbury, was born on the 14th of July 1829, at Birmingham.
He came of a family of Yorkshire dalesmen, his father, whose
name was also Edward White Benson, being a manufacturing
chemist of some note. He was educated at King Edward VI.&rsquo;s
school, Birmingham, under James Prince Lee, afterwards bishop
of Manchester, and amongst his school-fellows were B.F. Westcott
and J.B. Lightfoot, both of whom preceded him to Trinity
College, Cambridge, where he was elected a sub-sizar in 1848,
becoming subsequently sizar and scholar. The death of his
widowed mother in 1850 left him almost without resources, with
a family of younger brothers and sisters dependent upon him.
Relations came to his aid, and presently his anxieties were
relieved by Francis Martin, bursar of Trinity, who gave him
liberal help. Benson took his degree in 1852 as a senior optime,
eighth classic and senior chancellor&rsquo;s medallist, and was elected
fellow of Trinity in the following year. He became a master at
Rugby, first under E.M. Goulburn, and then (1857) under
Frederick Temple, who became his lifelong friend; he was also
ordained deacon in 1854 and priest in 1856. From Rugby he
went to be first headmaster of Wellington College, which was
opened in January 1859; and in the course of the same year he
married his cousin, Mary Sidgwick. The school flourished under
his management and also developed his administrative abilities,
but gradually his thoughts began to turn towards other work.
In 1868 he became prebendary of Lincoln and examining chaplain
to Bishop Christopher Wordsworth, an office which he also held
for a short time in 1870 for Dr Temple, just appointed to the see
of Exeter. In 1872 his acceptance of the chancellorship of
Lincoln opened a new period of his life. As chancellor, the
statutes directed him to study theology, to train others in that
study and to oversee the educational work of the diocese. To
such work Benson at once devoted himself; and did more
perhaps than any other man to reinvigorate cathedral life in
England. He started a theological college (the <i>Scholae Cancellarii</i>),
founded night schools, delivered courses of lectures on
church history, held Bible classes, and was instrumental in
founding a society of mission preachers for the diocese, the
&ldquo;Novate Novale.&rdquo; Early in 1877 he was consecrated first
bishop of Truro, and threw himself with characteristic vigour into
the work of organizing the new diocese. His knowledge, his
sympathy, his enthusiasm soon made themselves felt everywhere;
the ruridecanal conferences of clergy became a real force, and the
church in Cornwall was inspired with a vitality that had never
been possible when it was part of the unwieldy diocese of Exeter.
A chapter was constituted, the bishop being dean; amongst its
members was a canon missioner (the first to be appointed in
England), and the <i>Scholae Cancellarii</i> were founded after the
Lincoln pattern. Moreover, the bishop at once set to work to
build a cathedral. The foundation-stone was laid on the 20th of
May 1880, and on the 3rd of November 1887 the building, so
far as then completed, was consecrated. On the death of Dr
Tait, Benson was nominated to the see of Canterbury and was
enthroned on the 29th of March 1883. His primacy was one of
almost unprecedented activity.</p>

<p>Frequent communications passed between him and the heads
of the Eastern Churches. With their approval a bishop was again
consecrated, after six years&rsquo; interval (1881-1887), for the Anglican
congregations in Jerusalem and the East; and the features which
had made the plan objectionable to many English churchmen
were now abolished. In 1886, after much careful investigation,
he founded the &ldquo;Archbishop&rsquo;s Mission to the Assyrian Christians,&rdquo;
having for its object the instruction and the strengthening
from within of the &ldquo;Nestorian&rdquo; churches of the East (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Nestorians</a></span>). An interchange of courtesies with the Metropolitan
of Kiev on the occasion of the 900th anniversary of the conversion
of Russia (1888), led to further intercourse, which has tended to a
friendlier feeling between the English and Russian churches. On
the other hand, with the efforts towards a <i>rapprochement</i> with
the Church of Rome, to which the visit of the French Abbé
Portal in 1894 gave some stimulus, the archbishop would have
nothing to do.</p>

<p>With the other churches of the Anglican Communion the
archbishop&rsquo;s relations were cordial in the extreme and grew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page745" id="page745"></a>745</span>
closer as time went on. Particular questions of importance, the
Jerusalem bishopric, the healing of the Colenso schism in the
diocese of Natal, the organization of native ministries and the
like, occupied much of his time; and he did all in his power to
foster the growth of local churches. But it was the work at home
which occupied most of his energies. That he in no way slighted
diocesan work had been shown at Truro. He complained now
that the bishops were &ldquo;bishops of their dioceses but not bishops
of England,&rdquo; and did all he could to make the Church a greater
religious force in English life. He sat on the ecclesiastical courts
commission (1881-1883) and the sweating commission (1888-1890).
He brought bills into parliament to reform Church
patronage and Church discipline, and worked unremittingly for
years in their behalf. The latter became law in 1892, and the
former was merged in the Benefices Bill, which passed in 1898,
after his death. He wrote and spoke vigorously against Welsh
disestablishment (1893); and in the following year, under his
guidance, the existing agencies for Church defence were consolidated.
He was largely instrumental in the inauguration of the
House of Laymen in the province of Canterbury (1886); he made
diligent inquiries as to the internal order of the sisterhoods of
which he was visitor; from 1884 onwards he gave regular Bible
readings for ladies in Lambeth Palace chapel. But the most
important ecclesiastical event of his primacy was the judgment
in the case of the bishop of Lincoln (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lincoln Judgment</a></span>), in
which the law of the prayer-book is investigated, as it had never
been before, from the standpoint of the whole history of the
English Church. In 1896 the archbishop went to Ireland to see the
working of the sister Church. He was received with enthusiasm,
but the work which his tour entailed over-fatigued him. On
Sunday morning the 11th of October, just after his return, whilst
on a visit to Mr Gladstone, he died in Hawarden parish church of
heart failure.</p>

<p>Archbishop Benson left numerous writings, including a
valuable essay on <i>The Cathedral</i> (London, 1878), and various
charges and volumes of sermons and addresses. But his two
chief works, posthumously published, are his <i>Cyprian</i> (London,
1897), a work of great learning, which had occupied him at
intervals since early manhood; and <i>The Apocalypse, an Introductory
Study</i> (London, 1900), interesting and beautiful, but
limited by the fact that the method of study is that of a Greek
play, not of a Hebrew apocalypse. The archbishop&rsquo;s knowledge
of the past was both wide and minute, but it was that of an
antiquary rather than of a historian. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; writes his
son, &ldquo;he was more interested in modern movements for their
resemblance to ancient than vice versa.&rdquo; His sermons are very
noble though written in a style which is over-compressed and
often obscure. He wrote some good hymns, including &ldquo;O
Throned, O Crowned&rdquo; and a beautiful version of <i>Urbs Beata</i>.
His &ldquo;grandeur in social function&rdquo; was unequalled and his
interests were very wide. But above all else he was a great
ecclesiastic. He paid less attention to secular politics than
Archbishop Tait; but if a man is to be judged by the effect of
his work, it is Benson and not Tait who should be described as a
great statesman. His biography, by his son, reveals him as a
man of devout and holy life, impulsive indeed and masterful,
but one who learned self-restraint by strenuous endeavour.</p>

<p>His eldest son, <span class="sc">Arthur Christopher Benson</span> (b. 1862), was
educated at Eton and King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge. He became
fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge, and was a master at
Eton College from 1885 to 1903. His literary capacity was
early shown in the remarkable fiction of his <i>Memoirs of Arthur
Hamilton</i> (1886) under the pseudonym of &ldquo;Christopher Carr,&rdquo;
and his <i>Poems</i> (1893) and <i>Lyrics</i> (1895) established his reputation
as a writer of verse. Among his works are <i>Fasti Etonenses</i> (1899);
his father&rsquo;s <i>Life</i> (1899); <i>The Schoolmaster</i> (1902), a commentary
on the aims and methods of an assistant schoolmaster in a
public school; a study of Archbishop Laud (1887); monographs
on D.G. Rossetti (1904), Edward FitzGerald (1905) and
Walter Pater (1906), in the &ldquo;English Men of Letters&rdquo; series;
<i>Lord Vyet and other Poems</i> (1897), <i>Peace and other Poems</i>
(1905); <i>The Upton Letters (1905), From a College Window</i>
(1906), <i>Beside Still Waters</i> (1907). He also collaborated with
Lord Esher in editing the <i>Correspondence of Queen Victoria</i>
(1907).</p>

<p>The third son, <span class="sc">Edward Frederick Benson</span> (b. 1867), was
educated at Marlborough College and King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.
He worked at Athens for the British Archaeological Society
from 1892 to 1895, and subsequently in Egypt for the Hellenic
Society. In 1893 his society novel, <i>Dodo</i>, brought him to the
front among the writers of clever fiction; and this was followed
by other novels, notably <i>The Vintage</i> (1898) and <i>The Capsina</i> (1899).</p>

<p>The fourth son, <span class="sc">Robert Hugh Benson</span> (b. 1871), was educated
at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. After reading with
Dean Vaughan at Llandaff he took orders, and in 1898 became
a member of the Community of the Resurrection at Mirfield.
In 1903 he became a Roman Catholic, was ordained priest at
Rome in the following year, and returned to Cambridge as
assistant priest of the Roman Catholic church there. Among
his numerous publications are <i>The Light Invisible, By What
Authority?, The King&rsquo;s Achievement, Richard Raynal, Solitary,
The Queen&rsquo;s Tragedy, The Sentimentalists, Lord of the World</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENSON, FRANCIS ROBERT<a name="ar231" id="ar231"></a></span> (1858-&emsp;&emsp;), English actor, son
of William Benson of Alresford, Hants, was born at Tunbridge
Wells on the 4th of November 1858. He came of a talented
family, his elder brother, W.A.S. Benson (b. 1854), becoming
well known in the world of art as one of the pioneers in the
revival of English industrial craftsmanship, especially in the
field of the metallic arts; and his younger brother, Godfrey
Benson, being an active Liberal politician. He was educated
at Winchester and New College, Oxford, and at the university
was distinguished both as an athlete (winning the Inter-university
three miles) and as an amateur actor. In the latter respect he
was notable for producing at Oxford the first performance of a
Greek play, the <i>Agamemnon</i>, in which many Oxford men who
afterwards became famous in other fields took part. Mr Benson,
on leaving Oxford, took to the professional stage, and made
his first appearance at the Lyceum, under Irving, in <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i>, as Paris, in 1882. In the next year he went into managership
with a company of his own, taken over from Walter Bentley,
and from this time he became gradually more and more prominent,
both as an actor of leading parts himself and as the organizer
of practically the only modern &ldquo;stock company&rdquo; touring
through the provinces. In 1886 he married Gertrude Constance
Cockburn (Featherstonhaugh), who acted in his company and
continued to play leading parts with him. Mr Benson&rsquo;s chief
successes were gained out of London for some years, but in 1890
he had a season in London at the Globe and in 1900 at the
Lyceum, and in later years he was seen with his <i>répertoire</i> at the
Coronet. His company included from time to time many actors
and actresses who, having been trained under him, became
prominent on their own account, and both by his organization
of this regular company and by his foundation of a dramatic
school of acting in 1901, Mr Benson exercised a most important
influence on the contemporary stage. From the first he devoted
himself largely to the production of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, reviving
many which had not been acted for generations, and his services
to the cause of Shakespeare can hardly be overestimated. From
1888 onwards he managed the Stratford-on-Avon Shakespearian
Festival. His romantic and intellectual powers as an actor,
combined with his athletic and picturesque bearing and fine
elocution, were conspicuously shown in his own impersonations,
most remarkable among which were his Hamlet (in 1900 he
produced this play without cuts in London), his Coriolanus, his
Richard II., his Lear and his Petruchio.</p>

<p><span class="bold">BENSON, FRANK WESTON<a name="ar232" id="ar232"></a></span> (1862-&emsp;&emsp;), American painter,
was born in Salem, Massachusetts, on the 24th of March 1862.
He was a pupil of Boulanger and of Lefebvre in Paris; won

<p><span class="bold">BENSON, GEORGE<a name="ar233" id="ar233"></a></span> (1699-1762), English dissenting minister,
was born at Great Salkeld, in Cumberland, on the 1st of September
1699, of a family which had distinguished itself in church
and state. He studied at a school at Whitehaven and later at the
university of Glasgow. In 1722, on Calamy&rsquo;s recommendation,
he was chosen pastor of a congregation of dissenters at Abingdon,
in Berkshire, where he continued till 1729, when, having embraced
Arminian views, he became the choice of a congregation
in Southwark; and in 1740 he was appointed by the congregation
of Crutched Friars colleague to the learned Dr Nathaniel Lardner,
whom he succeeded in 1749. His <i>Defence of the Reasonableness of
Prayer</i> appeared in 1731, and he afterwards published paraphrases
and notes on the epistles to the Thessalonians, Timothy,
Titus and Philemon, adding dissertations on several important
subjects, particularly (as an appendix to 1 Timothy) on inspiration.
In 1738 he published his <i>History of the First Planting of the
Christian Religion</i>, in 3 vols. 4to, a work of great learning and
ability. He also wrote the <i>Reasonableness of the Christian
Religion</i> (1743), the <i>History of the Life of Jesus Christ</i>, posthumously
published in 1764, a paraphrase and notes on the
seven Catholic epistles, and several other works, which gained him
great reputation as a scholar and theologian even outside his
own communion and his own country. Owing to his undoubted
Socinianism his works suffered neglect after his death, which
occurred on the 6th of April 1762.</p>
